The 33/34 SI series alternator is a brushless, heavy-duty 
integral charging system with built-in diode rectifier and 
voltage  regulator,  producing  DC  current  for  battery 
electrical systems.  The 33/34 SI series is designed for use 
on large and mid-range diesel and gasoline engines in over                                                                                      33-6212
