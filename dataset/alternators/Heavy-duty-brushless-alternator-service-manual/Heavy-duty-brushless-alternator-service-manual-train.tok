heat
sink
.
Touch
positive
ohmmeter
lead
firmly
to
metal
diode
clips
that
surround
each
of
the
3
threaded
studs
.
All
3
readings
should
be
the
same
,
and
indicate
open
circuits
.
Switch
leads
and
repeat
.
All
3
new
readings
should
indicate
continuity
-LRB-

-RRB-
Repeat
checks
using
insulated
-LRB-
positive
-RRB-
heat
sink
in
place
of
grounded
heat
sink
.
With
negative
ohmmeter
lead
on
insulated
heat
sink
,
all
3
readings
should
indicate
continuity
.
Switch
leads
and
repeat
.
All
3
new
readings
should
indicate
open
circuits
.
If
all
readings
are
correct
,
the
rectifier
bridge
is
good
.
If
any
reading
is
wrong
,
an
open
or
shorted
diode
is
indicated
and
rectifier
bridge
should
be
replaced
.
To
remove
bridge
,
remove
nut
-LRB-

STATOR
Disconnect
the
3
stator
phase
leads
-LRB-
B
-RRB-
from
the
diode
bridge
studs
by
removing
3
nuts
-LRB-
218
-RRB-
.
Use
continuity
check
function
of
ohmmeter
to
check
stator
windings
.
-LRB-
See
Fig.
18
-RRB-
Place
one
meter
lead
on
one
of
the
stator
phase
lead
connectors
and
check
for
continuity
to
each
of
the
other
two
stator
leads.There
should
be
continuity
to
both
.
If
not
,
one
or
more
of
the
stator
coils
is
open
;
replace
the
stator
as
described
later
in
this
section
.
To
check
for
grounds
,
again
touch
one
meter
lead
to
one
of
the
stator
phase
leads
,
and
touch
the
other
meter
lead
to
clean
metal
ground
on
the
alternator
housing
.
There
should
not
be
continuity
.
If
there
is
continuity
,
the
stator
is
grounded
and
should
be
replaced
as
described
later
in
this
section
.
It
is
not
possible
to
detect
shorted
stator
windings
with
ordinary
shop
equipment
.
However
,
if
all
other
electrical
checks
are
normal
and
the
alternator
has
exhibited
low
output
,
shorted
stator
windings
may
be
the
cause
.
In
such
cases
,
replace
the
stator
as
described
later
in
this
section
.
FINAL
DISASSEMBLY
NOTICE
:
Do
not
damage

leave
a
place
for
a
short
circuit

The
bench
test
procedure
will
verify
alternator
performance
prior
to
installation
on
the
vehicle
.
This
test
checks
the
alternator
output
in
the
same
manner
as
the
Rated
Output
Check
covered
earlier
.
If
bench
test
equipment
is
not
available
,
install
the
alternator
on
the
engine
according
to
manufacturer
's
instructions
and
repeat
the
Rated
Output
Check
to
verify
alternator
operation
.
If
bench
test
equipment
is
available
,
proceed
as
follows
:
Mount
alternator
in
test
stand
according
to
test
stand
manufacturer
's
instructions
.
IMPORTANT
:
Battery
or
battery
set
must
be
fully
charged
for
test
results
to
be
valid
.
NOTICE
:
When
a
12-volt
carbon
pile
load
test
is
used
to
diagnose
a
24-volt
system
,
attach
load
test
only
to
12-volt
potential
in
battery
set
.
Attaching
a
12-volt
load
test
to
a
24-volt
potential
will
damage
the
carbon
pile
.
With
carbon
pile
load
turned
off
and
with
battery
or
battery
set
fully
charged
,
make
electrical
connections
as
shown
in
Fig.
41
.
Battery
voltage
and
ground
polarity
must
be
same
as
system
in
which
alternator
is
used
.
Check
and
record
battery
or
battery
set
voltage
before
proceeding
with
test
.
With
carbon
pile
load
off
,
start
test
stand
and
slowly
increase
alternator
speed
to
highest
rpm
shown
under
Cold
Output
specifications
in
33/34
SI
Alternator
Specifications
at
the
end
of
this
manual
.
Observe

.
-
If
voltage
does
not
increase
but
remains
at
or
below
previous
reading
-LRB-
Step
2
-RRB-
,
there
is
no
alternator
output
.
Turn
carbon
pile
load
off
and
stop
test
stand
.
Residual
magnetism
in
rotor
may
have
been
lost
.
Skip
to
Step
5
.
-
If
voltage
increases
above
15.5
volts
on
12-volt
system
-LRB-
or
above
31
volts
on
24-volt
system
-RRB-
,
voltage
is
uncontrolled
.
Turn
carbon
pile
load
off
and
stop
test
stand
.
Recheck
alternator
for
proper
assembly
.
If
alternator
has
been
assembled
properly
,
replace
regulator
as
described
under
Unit
Repair
.
Also
check
field
coil
for
shorts
and
replace
if
defective
.
-
If
voltage
is
proper
,
proceed
to
next
step
.
With
alternator
running
at
highest
rpm
shown
under
Cold
Output
in
Specifications
,
turn
on
carbon
pile
load
and
adjust
to
obtain
maximum
alternator
output
on
ammeter
.
-
If
ammeter
reading
is
within
15
amps
of
Cold
Output
in
Specifications
,
alternator
is
good
.
Turn
off
carbon
pile
load
and
stop
test
stand
.
-
If
ammeter
reading
is
more
than
15
amps
below
specification
,
alternator
is
not
operating
properly
.
Turn
off
carbon
pile
load
and
stop
test
stand
.
Return
to
Unit
Repair
section
in
this
manual
and
re-diagnose
the
alternator
.
CAUTION
:
Do
not
allow
jumper
lead
to
be
accidentally
grounded
while

.
If
the
free

of
this
lead
is
accidentally
touched
to
the
alternator

or
other
grounded
areas
,
the
jumper
lead
may
quickly
get
hot
enough
to
cause
a
skin
burn
or
to
damage
the
