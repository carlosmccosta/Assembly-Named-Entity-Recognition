                                       P/N 001544 
                         Assembly Instructions 

   1.      Installing Input Shaft and Gear,  Install Front Bearing (item 3) into Main Housing 
           (item 1) Bearing will install from back side of Housing. 
   2.      Install Key (item 2) into Input Shaft, Slide input Gear (item 6) on to Shaft from front Side. 
   3.      Install Input Seal into Main Housing from the Out Side or Seal can be installed later if 
           wanted, If Seal is installed coat ID of Seal with light coat of Grease and also coat area 
           on Shaft where Seal contacts Shaft. 
   4.      Drop Input Shaft with Gear on it through Seal and Main Housing from the Back of Main 
           Housing. Use caution not to damage Input Seal if it has been installed 
   5.      Insert Rear Cover O-Ring (item 18) into Housing and coat it with a light coat of grease. 
           Push Rear Cover  (item 16) into Housing, Cover is held in place by Shoulder Ring (item 
           17) which is installed now. 
   6.      Installing Output Shaft (item 13) , with Bearings and componts as shown in Drawing 
           into Main Housing (Item 1), install Input shaft before installing Output Shaft 
   7.      Install components onto Output Shaft (item 13), First slide the Shims (item 12) at top 
           of Output Shaft under Gear on use the same quanity as was removed, Install Top 
           Bearing (item 3) on till it seats against Shims. 
   8.      Slide Lower Bearing Spacer (item 7) on Output Shaft, This Spacer has the OD same 
           as the Bearings so it will be loose on Shaft.  Put Lower Bearing (item 3) on Shaft til it 
           seats against Bearing Spacer. 
   9.      Install more Shims (item 12) on output shaft, Use same Quanity as was taken off. 
           Install the External Snap ring (item 9) onto Output Shaft. 
   10      The Out out Shaft, Bearings, Shims, Bearing Spacer and Snap Ring  should be all one 
           assembly now.  Slide this assembly up into Main Housing from the Bottom, It may be 
           rquired to move Bearing spacer side to side to keep it lined up. Slide assembly in till 
           upper Bearing bottoms out in Housing. 
   11.     Install Lower Internal Snap Ring (item 8) into lower end of Main Housing, This retains 
           Output Shaft and components. DO NOT install lower Seal at this Time. 
   12.     Check Shaft for end Play and Gear Back-Lash, there should be no end play, If there 
           is install more Shims (item 12) on Shaft, If Shaft is to tight use less Shims. Gear Back- 
           Lash should be .016" to .019" if it is not then move Shims (item 12) from Top  to Bottom 
           or Bottom to Top, Where ever they are moved from they will have to go to the other end 
           to keep End Play correct. 
   13.     Install Lower Seal ( Item 11 Dust Shield), Coat Seal ID with light coat of grease, Install 
           Shoulder Ring (item 10) 
   14.     Fill Gearbox with oil. DO NOT  Fill with Oil above Oil Level Plug. Wait  a while  let 
           Gearbox sit and have time for Oil to run down into lower Bearings and recheck Oil 
           Level. ALWAYS recheck Oil Level after running  Mower 1/2 to 1 hour. Inspect Seals 
           for leaking after filling with Oil and after running 1/2 to 1 hour.

                                        P/N 00749003 
                            Assembly Instructions 

11.     Slide Input Gear (item 43) down over Input Shaft till it is bottomed out against External Retaining 
        Ring (24) that was installed on shaft earlier.  If Gear will not seat against Snap Ring check 
        Number of Shims (item 39) used at rear Bearing Cap. Drop Outer Input Bearing Cone (item 
        15) down over input Shaft till it seats against Gear (item 43). 
12.     Install Outer Bearing Cup (item 14) into Front Bearing cap (item 2) using Shims (item 38 a/r) slide 
        front bearing cap down over Input Shaft, Bolt (item 29)  Bearing cap to front of Main Housing snug 
        but do not torque go to step 13. 
13.     There are two adjustments that must be performed now, First is Bearing Pre-Load on Input shaft. 
        Pre-Load should be 14" to  16" lbs of rolling Torque, this is done by adding or removing shims to 
        front and/ or rear cover. DO NOT try to set Gear Back lash at this time leave it wide enough that 
        the Bearing Pre-Load is not affected. When Bearing Pre-Load is correct it is time to set Gear Back- 
        Lash, It will be set at  .016" to .019", this is done by moving Shims,  Example if more Back- 
        Lash is needed remove a .007"  Shim from rear Bearing cap and add a .007" Shim to front Bearing 
        cap or Vice versa, if less Back-Lash is needed, But always add a shim to the opposite end when 
        one is remove or added this will keep Bearing Pre-Load from changing. Tighten Retaining  Bolts 
        (item 24) on front Bearing cap & (Item 27) on rear bearing Cap and 
        recheck settings. 
14.     Install Input Shaft front Seal (item 33) now, Coat the ID of Seal with Light coat of grease before 
        installing into Bearing cap (item 2). 
15.     Install Side Output  Shaft  (Side Drive) Third & Fourth, Bearings, Gear into  Side Drive 
        Housings (item 5) and istall Side Drive Housing Assembly into Main Housing (item 1), Left & Right 
        Side Drive Housing Assemblys will Assemble the Same. 
16.     Install Inner Bearing Cup 22) and Outer Bearing Cup (item 20) into Side Drive Housing (item 5), 
        Install bearing Cups till they are seated into Housing.  Install Outer Bearing Cone (item 21) onto 
        Side Drive Shaft (item 7) from gear end till it is seated against shoulder on shaft. Drop Shaft into 
        Housing from gear Side. Slide inner Bearing Cone (item 23) onto Shaft from Gear end. Slide Gear 
        (item 11) down on Shaft till seated against Bearing Cone. Install Washer (item 45) on shaft and 
        Screw Slotted Nut (item 36) onto Shaft. 
17.     Tighten Nut till slack is removed from Shaft & Bearings, Using a coated Hammer and/or Brass 
        Drift Pin and tap Shaft to make sure Bearings are seated. Tight Nut till you have a Bearing Pre- 
        Load of 14" to 16" lbs of Rolling Torque, install Cotter Pin (item 19) into end of Shaft to retain Slotted 
        Nut. Coat Side Drive Seal (item 25) ID with a light coat of grease and install it into Housing. Repeat 
        this prosess for the other Side Drive Assembly. 
18.     When Installing the Side Drive Housing Assembly into the Main Housing Assembly use the Side 
        Drive Housing Shims (item 37 a/r) to adjust Gear Back-Lash, More Shims will increase Back-Lash 
        and Less Shims will decrease it. Set Gears (item 11) Back-Lash at .016" to .019" clearance 
19.     Fill Gearbox with Oil, Before deciding Gearbox is full wait long enough for Oil to run down between 
        Output Shaft Bearing and Side Drive Bearings, Then recheck and refill with Oil, DO NOT fill above 
        Oil Level Plug, install Oil Plugs and check for leaks, After running Mower 1/2 to 1 hour check Oil 
        Level and recheck for leaks.

                                    P/N 00753190 
                         Assembly Instructions 

         Installation Part Numbers are for Gearbox #00753190 (540 RPM) 

    1.      Install Center Input / Output Shaft (item 13) , with Rear Bearings, Gear and componts 
           as shown in Drawing  into Main Housing (Item 12), install Input shaft before install- 
           ing Output Shafts to Wings,  Notice Item 15, these are compensating washer to 
           keep end play out of Shaft. there may be one ore more used. 
    2.      Install Snap Ring (Item 17) in Back of Housing (Item 12), this will retain Rear bearing 
           (item 21) DO NOT INSTALL REAR SEAL YET.  Install Front Spacer Washer (item 15) 
           and front Bearing with its componts. , Install Front Snap Ring (Item 17) DO NOT 
            INSTALL FRONT SEAL YET. Check Input shaft for End Play, If there is no end play 
           Still DO NOT Install any seal at this time. Front and Rear Seal can be installed at this 
           time, If there is end Play it may be required to remove or Add Washers (item # 15). 
            IMPORTANT Rememer these are Ball Bearings and you DO NOT Pre-Load Ball 
            Bearings. 
    3.      Looking down into Gearbox Housing you will see casting part for Inner Bearing on 
           Output Shafts to Wings. Install Inner Bearing (item 3) with Compensating Rings (item 
           7) as  needed. put gear down into Housing, Insert Shaft from outside into housing. 
            Insert Shims and outer Bearing (item 3). To set Backlash on gears it may be rquired 
           to add or remove Compensating Rings (item7) to move Gear closer or further away 
           from center Gear. The Gear Back lash should be .014" to .016" and shafts should NOT 
           have End Play.  Make sure of all parts install and gear Back Lash is correct, If Shaft 
           has end Play but Back Lash is correct the end Play can be removed by adding or 
           removing outer bearing washer (item 2). Both Side Drive Output Shafts will install the 
           same way. 
    4.     To Install Input and Output Seals into Main Housing.  BEFORE installing Seals check 
            Housing where seal installs to make sure the opening HAS NO burrs or scratches, The 
           outer edge of opening can get sharp edges on it from installing the previous Seal. 
           These sharp edges will cut outer edge of Seal, if these burrs or sharp edge are not 
           removed Seals may leak, If this happens look for a group of scratches that run across 
           the outer edge of seal when removed. To install the Seals it is best to use a Seal driver 
               of the right size. Shaft  area and inner ID of Seal should be coated with light coat of 
           grease before installing. 
    5.      Install top cover using Gasket or Gasket sealer,  Fill Gearbox with oil. Gearbox can be 
           filled with oil before top cover is installed if wanted. DO NOT  Fill with Oil above Oil 
            Level Plug. ALWAYS recheck Oil Level after running  Mower 1/2 to 1 hour. Inspect 
           Seals for leaking after filling with Oil and after running 1/2 to 1 hour.

                                       GEARBOX 
                                   P/N 00754005 
                        Assembly Instructions 

   1.      Install Center Input / Output Shaft (item 13) , with Rear Bearings, Gear and componts 
           as shown in Drawing  into Main Housing (Item 12), install Input shaft before install- 
           ing Output Shafts to Wings,  Notice Item 15, these are compensating washer to 
           keep end play out of Shaft. there may be one ore more used. 
   2.      Install Snap Ring (Item 17) in Back of Housing (Item 12), this will retain Rear bearing 
           (item 21) DO NOT INSTALL REAR SEAL YET.  Install Front Spacer Washer (item 15) 
           and front Bearing with its componts. , Install Front Snap Ring (Item 17) DO NOT 
           INSTALL FRONT SEAL YET. Check Input shaft for End Play, If there is no end play 
           Still DO NOT Install any seal at this time. Front and Rear Seal can be installed at this 
           time, If there is end Play it may be required to remove or Add Washers (item # 15). 
           IMPORTANT Rememer these are Ball Bearings and you DO NOT Pre-Load Ball 
           Bearings. 
   3.      Looking down into Gearbox Housing you will see casting part for Inner Bearing on 
           Output Shafts to Wings. Install Inner Bearing (item 3) with Compensating Rings (item 
           7) as  needed. put gear down into Housing, Insert Shaft from outside into housing. 
           Insert Shims and outer Bearing (item 3). To set Backlash on gears it may be rquired 
           to add or remove Compensating Rings (item7) to move Gear closer or further away 
           from center Gear. The Gear Back lash should be .014" to .016" and shafts should NOT 
           have End Play.  Make sure of all parts install and gear Back Lash is correct, If Shaft 
           has end Play but Back Lash is correct the end Play can be removed by adding or 
           removing outer bearing washer (item 2). Both Side Drive Output Shafts will install the 
           same way. 
   4.      To Install Input and Output Seals into Main Housing.  BEFORE installing Seals check 
           Housing where seal installs to make sure the opening HAS NO burrs or scratches, The 
           outer edge of opening can get sharp edges on it from installing the previous Seal. 
           These sharp edges will cut outer edge of Seal, if these burrs or sharp edge are not 
           removed Seals may leak, If this happens look for a group of scratches that run across 
           the outer edge of seal when removed. To install the Seals it is best to use a Seal driver 
              of the right size. Shaft  area and inner ID of Seal should be coated with light coat of 
           grease before installing. 
   5.      Install top cover using Gasket or Gasket sealer,  Fill Gearbox with oil. Gearbox can be 
           filled with oil before top cover is installed if wanted. DO NOT  Fill with Oil above Oil 
           Level Plug. ALWAYS recheck Oil Level after running  Mower 1/2 to 1 hour. Inspect 
           Seals for leaking after filling with Oil and after running 1/2 to 1 hour.

         secure Bearing Adjusting Nut  with Cotter Pin. 
6.       DO NOT Install Output Seal (#00755627) now, wait till Input Shaft has been installed, When you 
         do install it Coat ID of Seal with light coat of grease. Install Seal Protector (#00755626), this drives 
         into lower Main Housing, This Seal Protector Should always be replaced with new one after being 
         removed. Re-Check Bearing Pre-load. Output Shaft Should have NO end play and Bearing MUST 
         be set at a rolling Torque. (See 5.) 
7.       Install Input Shaft, Bearings and Gear into Main Housing (#00755613) 
8.       Install External Clip (#00755620) on Input Shaft (#00755617) next to where Gear goes. Install 
         External Clip (#00755632) on Input Shaft next to rear Bearing area. Drop Input Gear (#00755614) 
         into Gearbox Main Housing from the top. Holding Gear inplace insert Input Shaft into Main Housing 
         from the rear through rear Bearing opening on center and left wing Gearbox, from the front on 
         Right wing Gearbox. Slide shaft guiding it through input Gear. slide Shaft in till External Clip is against 
         Gear.

         front till they are against Input Gear. Install Shims against Bearing Cup, Install Internal Clip 
         (#00755618) into front of Main Housing against Shims. DO NOT install any Seals at this time. 
 10.     Check Bearing Pre-Load (should be 14" to 16" pounds of rolling Torque) and Gear Back Lash 
         between Blade Shaft Gear and Input Gear (should have .017" to .019" back Lash) If it is not correct, 
         Add or remove shims from Input Shaft Bearings will change Bearing Pre-load,  Move Shim from one 
         side of input Bearing to other to Get Correct Back Lash, It may be required to add or remove shims 
         from Blade Shaft output Gear to raise or lower it to get correct Back lash. Once all is correct Install 
         Input Seal (#00755616) and Rear Seal Cap (#00755634) then recheck Gear and Bearing settings.

          INSTALL ANY SEALS TILL GEARBOX IS COMPLETLY ASSEMBLED ! Before you 
          install the seals check the openings for burrs or scratches that will damage or prevent 
          the OD of the seal from sealing. Remove any Burrs and fill scratch with good gasket 
          Sealer 
   2.     Install Snap Ring (Item 10) in Back of Housing (Item 9), this will retain Rear bearing 
          (item 16) DO NOT install Rear Seal (item 11) at this time.  Install Front Shims (item 
          12), Qty use same as was removed as this amount can vary. Slide rear Bearing (item 
          16) into housing (item 9) this can be done from inside. Push Bearing in till it seats 
          against the Shims & Snap Ring (items 10 & 12). 
   3.     Holding Input Gear (item 17) into Gearbox Housing (item 9) from the top slide the Input 
          Shaft (item 14) into the Housing from the front. Slide Shaft through Gear and Rear 
          Bearing. 
   4.     Install Front Bearing (item 13) on input Shaft from the front. Slide Bearing till it goes 
          into Geabox Housing and seats against Shoulder on Input Shaft. Install Shims (item 
          12) using quanity that will will allow end play to be removed, This is a trial & error 
          method because you will need to install Snap Ring (item 10) to check then remove it 
          to add or remove Shims. These are ball Bearings so they will not have Pre-Load. 
          DO NOT install Front Seal (item 11) at this time. 
   5.     Install Output Shaft to Side Drives, The Left & Right Shafts will install the Same using 
          the same Part Numbers. it is best to install Parts for both Side Drive Shafts at same 
          time. 
   6.     Looking down into gearbox Housing (item 9)  you can see the inner casting for the Inner 
          Bearing (item 7), There will be adjusting Shims (item 8) that need to be installed here 
          before Bearing is. The quanity of Shims will vary, Try the same amount as was 
          removed here. Install the inner Bearing (item 7) into Housing. 
   7.     Side Output Shaft (item 1) has a Snap Ring Grove on it near outer Bearing (item 
          5)area. Slide Outer Bearing (item 5) onto Side Shaft (item 1) till it seats against 
          Shoulder on Shaft. Install Snap Ring (item 22) on Shaft next to Bearing. 
   8.     Take the Gear for Side Drive (item 6) and slide it down into Gearbox from the Top, With 
          the side Drive Gear in position against the Input Gear (item 17), take the Side drive 
          Shaft (item 1) and Slide it through the Housing from the out side, rotating Shaft as you 
          push it through to align Splines on shaft with spline in Gear. Push the Shaft in till the 
          Bearing is into Housing and the shoulder on Shaft seats against inner Bearing.

                                      GEARBOX 
                                  P/N 00755698 
                      Assembly Instructions 

  1.      Install Center Input / Output Shaft (item 13) , with Rear Bearings, Gear and componts 
         as shown in Drawing  into Main Housing (Item 12), install Input shaft before install- 
         ing Output Shafts to Wings,  Notice Item 15, these are compensating washer to 
         keep end play out of Shaft. there may be one ore more used. 
  2.      Install Snap Ring (Item 17) in Back of Housing (Item 12), this will retain Rear bearing 
         (item 21) DO NOT INSTALL REAR SEAL YET.  Install Front Spacer Washer (item 15) 
         and front Bearing with its componts. , Install Front Snap Ring (Item 17) DO NOT 
          INSTALL FRONT SEAL YET. Check Input shaft for End Play, If there is no end play 
         Still DO NOT Install any seal at this time. Front and Rear Seal can be installed at this 
         time, If there is end Play it may be required to remove or Add Washers (item # 15). 
          IMPORTANT Rememer these are Ball Bearings and you DO NOT Pre-Load Ball 
         Bearings. 
  3.     Looking down into Gearbox Housing you will see casting part for Inner Bearing on 
         Output Shafts to Wings. Install Inner Bearing (item 3) with Compensating Rings (item 
         7) as  needed. put gear down into Housing, Insert Shaft from outside into housing. 
          Insert Shims and outer Bearing (item 3). To set Backlash on gears it may be rquired 
         to add or remove Compensating Rings (item7) to move Gear closer or further away 
         from center Gear. The Gear Back lash should be .014" to .016" and shafts should NOT 
         have End Play.  Make sure of all parts install and gear Back Lash is correct, If Shaft 
         has end Play but Back Lash is correct the end Play can be removed by adding or 
         removing outer bearing washer (item 2). Both Side Drive Output Shafts will install the 
         same way. 
  4.     To Install Input and Output Seals into Main Housing.  BEFORE installing Seals check 
         Housing where seal installs to make sure the opening HAS NO burrs or scratches, The 
         outer edge of opening can get sharp edges on it from installing the previous Seal. 
         These sharp edges will cut outer edge of Seal, if these burrs or sharp edge are not 
         removed Seals may leak, If this happens look for a group of scratches that run across 
         the outer edge of seal when removed. To install the Seals it is best to use a Seal driver 
             of the right size. Shaft  area and inner ID of Seal should be coated with light coat of 
         grease before installing. 
  5.      Install top cover using Gasket or Gasket sealer,  Fill Gearbox with oil. Gearbox can be 
         filled with oil before top cover is installed if wanted. DO NOT  Fill with Oil above Oil 
         Level Plug. ALWAYS recheck Oil Level after running  Mower 1/2 to 1 hour. Inspect 
         Seals for leaking after filling with Oil and after running 1/2 to 1 hour.

       Installation Part Numbers are for Gearbox #00756603A (540 RPM) 

   1.     Install Center Input / Output Shaft (item 14) , with Bearings, Gear and components 
          as shown in Drawing  into Main Housing (Item 9), install Input shaft before installing 
          Output Shafts to Wings,  Notice Item 12, these are Shim Washers (Compensating 
          Rings) to keep end play out of Shaft. there may be one ore more used. DO NOT 
          INSTALL ANY SEALS TILL GEARBOX IS COMPLETLY ASSEMBLED ! Before you 
          install the seals check the openings for burrs or scratches that will damage or prevent 
          the OD of the seal from sealing. Remove any Burrs and fill scratch with good gasket 
          Sealer 
   2.     Install Snap Ring (Item 10) in Back of Housing (Item 9), this will retain Rear bearing 
          (item 16) DO NOT install Rear Seal (item 11) at this time.  Install Front Shims (item 
          12), Qty use same as was removed as this amount can vary. Slide rear Bearing (item 
          16) into housing (item 9) this can be done from inside. Push Bearing in till it seats 
          against the Shims & Snap Ring (items 10 & 12). 
   3.     Holding Input Gear (item 17) into Gearbox Housing (item 9) from the top slide the Input 
          Shaft (item 14) into the Housing from the front. Slide Shaft through Gear and Rear 
          Bearing. 
   4.     Install Front Bearing (item 13) on input Shaft from the front. Slide Bearing till it goes 
          into Geabox Housing and seats against Shoulder on Input Shaft. Install Shims (item 
          12) using quanity that will will allow end play to be removed, This is a trial & error 
          method because you will need to install Snap Ring (item 10) to check then remove it 
          to add or remove Shims. These are ball Bearings so they will not have Pre-Load. 
          DO NOT install Front Seal (item 11) at this time. 
   5.     Install Output Shaft to Side Drives, The Left & Right Shafts will install the Same using 
          the same Part Numbers. it is best to install Parts for both Side Drive Shafts at same 
          time. 
   6.     Looking down into gearbox Housing (item 9)  you can see the inner casting for the Inner 
          Bearing (item 7), There will be adjusting Shims (item 8) that need to be installed here 
          before Bearing is. The quanity of Shims will vary, Try the same amount as was 
          removed here. Install the inner Bearing (item 7) into Housing. 
   7.     Side Output Shaft (item 1) has a Snap Ring Grove on it near outer Bearing (item 
          5)area. Slide Outer Bearing (item 5) onto Side Shaft (item 1) till it seats against 
          Shoulder on Shaft. Install Snap Ring (item 22) on Shaft next to Bearing. 
   8.     Take the Gear for Side Drive (item 6) and slide it down into Gearbox from the Top, With 
          the side Drive Gear in position against the Input Gear (item 17), take the Side drive 
          Shaft (item 1) and Slide it through the Housing from the out side, rotating Shaft as you 
          push it through to align Splines on shaft with spline in Gear. Push the Shaft in till the 
          Bearing is into Housing and the shoulder on Shaft seats against inner Bearing.

                                   P/N 00756604 
                        Assembly Instructions 

   1.      Install Center Input / Output Shaft (item 13) , with Rear Bearings, Gear and componts 
           as shown in Drawing  into Main Housing (Item 12), install Input shaft before install- 
           ing Output Shafts to Wings,  Notice Item 15, these are compensating washer to 
           keep end play out of Shaft. there may be one ore more used. 
   2.      Install Snap Ring (Item 17) in Back of Housing (Item 12), this will retain Rear bearing 
           (item 21) DO NOT INSTALL REAR SEAL YET.  Install Front Spacer Washer (item 15) 
           and front Bearing with its componts. , Install Front Snap Ring (Item 17) DO NOT 
           INSTALL FRONT SEAL YET. Check Input shaft for End Play, If there is no end play 
           Still DO NOT Install any seal at this time. Front and Rear Seal can be installed at this 
           time, If there is end Play it may be required to remove or Add Washers (item # 15). 
           IMPORTANT Rememer these are Ball Bearings and you DO NOT Pre-Load Ball 
           Bearings. 
   3.      Looking down into Gearbox Housing you will see casting part for Inner Bearing on 
           Output Shafts to Wings. Install Inner Bearing (item 3) with Compensating Rings (item 
           7) as  needed. put gear down into Housing, Insert Shaft from outside into housing. 
           Insert Shims and outer Bearing (item 3). To set Backlash on gears it may be rquired 
           to add or remove Compensating Rings (item7) to move Gear closer or further away 
           from center Gear. The Gear Back lash should be .014" to .016" and shafts should NOT 
           have End Play.  Make sure of all parts install and gear Back Lash is correct, If Shaft 
           has end Play but Back Lash is correct the end Play can be removed by adding or 
           removing outer bearing washer (item 2). Both Side Drive Output Shafts will install the 
           same way. 
   4.      To Install Input and Output Seals into Main Housing.  BEFORE installing Seals check 
           Housing where seal installs to make sure the opening HAS NO burrs or scratches, The 
           outer edge of opening can get sharp edges on it from installing the previous Seal. 
           These sharp edges will cut outer edge of Seal, if these burrs or sharp edge are not 
           removed Seals may leak, If this happens look for a group of scratches that run across 
           the outer edge of seal when removed. To install the Seals it is best to use a Seal driver 
              of the right size. Shaft  area and inner ID of Seal should be coated with light coat of 
           grease before installing. 
   5.      Install top cover using Gasket or Gasket sealer,  Fill Gearbox with oil. Gearbox can be 
           filled with oil before top cover is installed if wanted. DO NOT  Fill with Oil above Oil 
           Level Plug. ALWAYS recheck Oil Level after running  Mower 1/2 to 1 hour. Inspect 
           Seals for leaking after filling with Oil and after running 1/2 to 1 hour.

         Bearing Cup. 
 4.      Install Shims (#00755622) down over top of Output Shaft, The number of shims required will vary, 
         try to use the same amount as were removed. Install Output Gear (#00756900) over Output Shaft, 
         Make sure it is seated against Shim. Insert Shim (#00755638 washer) down against gear,  Screw 
         Slotted Bearing Adjusting Nut (#00756943) onto top of Out put Shaft. 
 5.      Tighten Bearing Adjusting Nut above Gear till Bearings have 14" to 16" pounds of rolling Torque then 
         secure Bearing Adjusting Nut  with Cotter Pin. 
 6.      DO NOT Install Output Seal (#00755627) now, wait till Input Shaft has been installed, When you 
         do install it Coat ID of Seal with light coat of grease. Install Seal Protector (#00755626), this drives 
         into lower Main Housing, This Seal Protector Should always be replaced with new one after being

         between Blade Shaft Gear and Input Gear (should have .017" to .019" back Lash) If it is not correct, 
         Add or remove shims from Input Shaft Bearings will change Bearing Pre-load,  Move Shim from one 
         side of input Bearing to other to Get Correct Back Lash, It may be required to add or remove shims 
         from Blade Shaft output Gear to raise or lower it to get correct Back lash. Once all is correct Install 
         Input Seal (#00755616) and Rear Seal Cap (#00755634) then recheck Gear and Bearing settings.

                           Assembly Instructions 

Assembly Instructions for Gearbox # 00757828 (540 RPM) 

1.      Install Output Shaft  (Blade Shaft), Bearings, Gear in Main Housing (#00758661) 
2.      Install Lower Bearing Cone (#00758650 Cup & Cone) on Output Shaft (#00758687) make sure 
        Bearing cone slides all the way down against shoulder at bottom of shaft. Slide Bearing Cup (part 
        of #00758650) down over Bearing Cone. 
3.      Screw the 2 pieces of Bearing Spacer (#00758679 outer & #00758662 inner) together, Screw 
         together BUT DO NOT bend to lock at this time. Slide Bearing Spacers down over Output Shaft. 
        (this 2 piece spacer can be replaced by using Kit #00761517, which replaces Spacer & output shaft 
        with later style) 
4.      Put Upper Bearing Cup (#00758650 Cup & Cone)over Shaft and slide down till it sits against 
        Bearing Spacer. Slide upper Bearing Cone (#00758650 Cup & Cone) down over Output Shaft till 
        it is against Bearing Cup, Install retaining Rings (#00758688 & #00758660) on Shaft above Upper 
        Bearing Cone. It may be required to shorten Bearing Spaced by screwing it together to get Snap 
        Ring on Shaft. 
5.      Look at Drawing, If assembled correct the Upper and Lower Bearing Cups and Cone will be on Shaft 
        Opposite each other. Screw Bearing Spacer apart till Bearings have 14" to 16" pounds of rolling 
        Torque Pre-Load. When this is done the Bearing Spacer WILL HAVE TO BE locked, This is done 
        by Bending Outer Bearing Spacer into Inner Bearing Spacer, You will see a groove (lookes like 
        keyway) in inner Spacer on threads, This is where you bend Outer Spacer down into this groove. 
        Make SURE it is staked in tight. 
6.      Slip Shaft with Bearings and Spacer into the Bottom Side of Main Housing, Push into shaft till upper 
        Bearing cup is bottomed out in Main Housing. Install Output Seal (#00758674) into Lower Output 
        Cap (#00758663), Coat ID of Seal with light coat of grease. Using Shims (#00758676, #00758677 
        and #00758678) quanity may vary and DO NOT USE gasket sealer on shims at this time, Install 
        Output Cap and tighten Bolts. Check Bearing Pre-load, If it is not correct remove or ad Shims a 
        needed. When Bearing pre-load is correct  remove and coat Shims with a Gasket Sealer then 
        retighten Bolts, Check Bearing Pre-load Again. Output Shaft Should have NO end play inward or 
        outward. and Bearing MUST be set at a rolling Torque. 
 7.     Check and install Shims (#00758666, #00758667 and #00758668) on top of Output Shaft under 
        Gear (#00758693 a 13 tooth gear), try to use same Quanity of shims as came off here. Sit Gear 
        down over Output Shaft and slide down making sure gear is seated against Shims. Later When 
        adjusting Gear Back Lash it may be required to add or remove some of these shims. 
8.      Install Input Shaft  (PTO end), Bearings, Gear in Main Housing (#00758702) 
9.      Install Gear Spacer (#00758657)  Input Shaft. Install Shim (#00758667 & #00758668) on Shaft next 
        to Gear Spacers (the quanity will vary, try to put same as taken off), Slide Input Gear (#00758694 
        a 19 tooth gear) on front side of shaft or rear of Shaft depending on Left or Right Gearbox till it is 
        against against Shims, Install Front Input Shaft Bearing Cone (#00758655 Cup & Cone) on front 
        of Input Shaft making sure it is against Shims. Install Rear Input Shaft Bearing Cone (#00758650 
        Cup & Cone) on rear of input Shaft making sure it is against shoulder on Shaft.

                         Assembly Instructions 

 10.     Install Rear Input Bearing Cup (#00758650 Cup & Cone) into Rear of Main Housing. lower Input 
         Shaft ( with Gears, Spacers, Shims and Bearing Cones on it) down into Main housing from front 
         side. Install Bearing Cup (#00758655 Cup & Cone) into Front Input Bearing Cap (#00758664), 
         Install Input Seal (#00758653) into Front Bearing Cap, Coat ID of Seal with light coat of grease. 
         Using Shims (#00758646, #00758647 & #00758648) on front cover set it down over input shaft, 
         Tighten Front cover Bolts. 
 11.     Check Bearing Pre-Load (should be 14" to 16" pounds of rolling Torque) and Gear Back Lash 
         between Blade Shaft Gear and Input Gear (should have .017" to .019" back Lash) If it is not 
         correct, Move Shim from one side of input gear to other to Get Correct Back Lash, It may be 
         required to add or remove shims from Blade Shaft output Gear to raise or lower it to get correct 
         Back lash. Once all is correct Tighten front cover bolts and recheck Gear and Bearing settings. 
 12.     When this has been Done fill Gearbox with Oil, Before deciding Gearbox is full wait long enough 
         for Oil to run down between Output Shaft Bearing, Then refill with Oil, install Oil Plugs and check 
         for leaks, After running Mower 1/2 to 1 hour check Oil Level and recheck for leaks.

           onto Output Shaft, Slide Shims (item 26.27,28) onto Shaft (when installing Shims try 
           Qty that was removed) Install Retaining Snap Ring (item 14) on output Shaft just below 
           upper Bearing and shims, You should have enough Shims (item 26,27,28) that Snap 
           Ring (item 14) holds Bearing, Spacer  and Shims snug on Shaft. 
   3.      Install Lower Bearing Space (item 15) on Output Shaft, Note that Bearing Spacer is 
           installed in the correct direction, There is a groove machined in the upper ID to slide 
           over Snap Ring (item 14) if it is not installed this way it will not work. 
   4.      Drop Lower Bearing Cone (item 13) down over Output Shaft, Slide Lower Bearing Cup 
           (item 13) down over Bearing Cone. Slide this completed Ouput Shaft with components 
           in to the Main Housing (item 8). Make sure that all components are slid in as far as they 
           will go. Using Lower Bearing Cap Shim Gaskets (item 23,24,25) DO NOT put Gasket 
           Sealer on Gaskets yet & DO NOT install lower Seal. Fit Bearing cap with Gasket 
           Shims (item 23,24,25) down over Output Shaft. Add or remove Gasket Shims to Set 
           Bearing Pre-Load in Output Shaft Bearings, Set Bearing Pre-Load from 14 to 16 inch 
           lbs of rolling torque. 
   5.      When Finished with Step 4 go on to installing Input Shaft or if only replacing  Out put 
           shaft go on to set Gear Back-Lash Step 9. 
   6.      Install Input Shaft & Gear.  Install Inner Input Shaft Bearing (item 9) into back of Main 
           Housing (item 6), make sure bearing is seated completly into Housing. 
   7.      Install Retaining Ring  (item 7) onto input Shaft (item 1), this is the one nearest the 
           middle of the Shaft (Note there are three grooves here make sure to install it in correct 
           one). Slide Input Gear (item 6) down onto input Shaft ( item 1) till it is seated against 
           Retaining Ring (item 7).  Slide Outer Input Bearing (item 3) down over Shaft till it seats 
           against Input Gear. 
   8.      Slide shaft w/ components into Gearbox Main Housing. Using Gasket/ Shims (item 5 
           Don't use gasket sealer or Install Input seal at this time) slide Input Bearing Cap (item 
           4) on over Input Shaft, Tighten till end Play is removed from Input Shaft by adding or 
           removing gaskets. 
   9.      Gear Back-Lash is set by moving Shims at upper Output Shaft Brg from below Brg to 
           above or Vice Versa. Also it can be changed by removeing or adding Shims (item 7) 
           on Input Shaft. Gear Back-Lash should be from .016" to .019" 
   10.     If Brg Back lash is OK remove Bearing Caps (item 16 & 4), Check Seal areas and 
           install Seal. Use Gasket sealer now if wanted & re-install Brg caps. Re-check Bearing 
           Back Lash & Lower Bearing Pre-Load. 
   11.     Fill Gearbox with oil. DO NOT  Fill with Oil above Oil Level Plug. Wait  a while  let 
           Gearbox sit and have time for Oil to run down into lower Bearings and recheck Oil 
           Level. ALWAYS recheck Oil Level after running  Mower 1/2 to 1 hour. Inspect Seals 
           for leaking after filling with Oil and after running 1/2 to 1 hour.

       Gearbox RPM CAN NOT be changed by reversing Gears. To Check which Gearbox 
       turn input shaft (item # 16) one complete turn, Cross Shaft (item # 6) will turn 1.46 
       turns  for 540 RPM  and 0.82  Turns  for 1000 RPM for every complete turn Iinput 
       Shaft is turned. The Outboard Gearboxes will turn 1 turn output for every turn input on 
       540 RPM or 1000 RPM as they use the same gearbox and the Gear Ratio is 
       changed in the Divider Gearbox.

         Install Side Bearing Cap (# 00762516) to the Right Side of Main Housing (# 00752519). Tighten 
         Bolts snug. 
 4.      Install Bearing Cone (# 00755628 Cup & Cone) onto Right Side of Cross Shaft (# 00762518) 
         Slide Gear Spacer (# 00755657 ) on to Left Side of Shaft till it rest against the Shoulder of Shaft. 
 5.      Slide the Output Gear (# 00759488) on to Cross Shaft from Left Side till it is againt the Gear 
         Spacer. Slide the other Bearing Cone (# 00755628 Cup & Cone) on against Gear. Coat the 
         Cross Shaft with light coat of Grease at the Seal wear area then Slide Cross Shaft with 
         Bearings, Spacer and Gear into Main housing from the Left Side and into the Bearing Cap 
         bolted on the right side. 
 6.      Using Shims from Shim Kit (# 00748531) DO NOT put gasket Sealer on Shims at this time, 
         Install Side Bearing Cap (# 00762516) to the Left Side of Main Housing (# 00752519). Tighten 
         Bolts snug. 
 7.      Check Bearing Pre-Load it should be 14 to 16 inch pounds of rolling torque, If it is not correct 
         remove or add Shims till it is correct. and re snug Bearing Cap Bolts. DO NOT Use Gasket 
         Sealer on Shims / Gaskets at this time. 
 8.      Install Input Shaft  (PTO Shaft), Bearings, Gear in Input Hub Housing (#00762520) 
 9.      Inspect the Hole in Bearing Caps for the Seal in All the openings , remove any sharp edges or 
         burrs before installing Seal, Inspect old Seal to make sure there are no lines cut across the 
         outer dia. of it. If there are this is good sign that burrs exist around hole. Install Bearing Cup 
         ( # 00755628 Cup & Cone)  into both ends of the Input Hub Housing, Besure to install them 
         as shown in drawing so the bearing cones can be installed from the outside. The Input Seal 
         (# 00762521)can be installed now into Input Housing (# 00762520). 
 10.     Slide Bearing Cone (# 00755628 Cup & Cone) onto input shaft from the Gear end, Make sure 
         that Bearing is down against shoulder on Shaft. Put light coat of grease on Shaft at Seal wear 
         area and around the ID of Seal then slide Input Shaft (#00762522) into Input Hub Housing. 
 11.     Slide Bearing Cone (# 00755628 Cup & Cone) onto input Shaft till it is seated in the Bearing 
         Cup. Slide Input Gear (# 00759487) onto Input Shaft till it bottomsout against Bearing Cone. 
 12.     Screw Bearing Adjust Nut (# 00762121) onto Input Shaft, Tighten Nut till Bearings have a Pre- 
         Load of 14 to 16 inch pounds of rolling torgue, Tap end of Shaft lightly with a Hammer to make 
         sure Bearing Cones are seated in Cups and Bearing Cones are seated against Shoulder on 
         Shaft. Recheck Bearing Preload, If it is correct install Cotter Pin (# 00026200)

                            Assembly Instructions 

 13.    Using Shims from Shim Kit (# 00748531) DO NOT put gasket Sealer on Shims at this time, 
        Install Input Hub Housing (# 00762520) in to the front of Main Housing (# 00752519). Tighten 
        Bolts snug. 
 14.    Check Gear Back-Lash, it should be from .017" to .019", To Set Back-Lash the Shims for the Input 
        Hub Housing will need to be removed or more added as needed. Also the wear pattern of the Gears 
        should be checked, This can be changed by moving Shims on the two Cross Shaft Bearing Caps 
        from one side or the other. DO NOT remove them completly, if you remove one from one side it 
        must be moved to the other side, this will move the cross shaft gear closer or further away from 
        input gear and keep the correct Bearing Pre-Load. 
 15.    When all Setting are correct remoce housings and caps, use sealer on shims if desired and Re- 
        Check all the Bolts to make sure they are tight. recheck all Settings one more time. 
 16.    Fill Gearbox with Oil, Before deciding Gearbox is full wait long enough for Oil to run down between 
        Shafts and Bearing, Then refill with Oil,  Install all Oil Fill & Vent Plugs, Check for leaks, After 
        running Mower 1/2 to 1 hour check Oil Level and recheck for leaks.

       Gearbox RPM CAN NOT be changed by reversing Gears. To Check which Gearbox 
       turn input shaft (item # 16) one complete turn, Cross Shaft (item # 6) will turn 1.46 
       turns  for 540 RPM  and 0.82  Turns  for 1000 RPM for every complete turn Input Shaft 
       is turned. The Outboard Gearboxes will turn 1 turn output for every turn input on 540 
       RPM or 1000 RPM as they use the same gearbox and the Gear Ratio is changed in 
       the Divider Gearbox.

                            Assembly Instructions 

 13.    Using Shims from Shim Kit (# 00748531) DO NOT put gasket Sealer on Shims at this time, 
        Install Input Hub Housing (# 00762520) in to the front of Main Housing (# 00752519). Tighten 
        Bolts snug. 
 14.    Check Gear Back-Lash, it should be from .017" to .019", To Set Back-Lash the Shims for the Input 
        Hub Housing will need to be removed or more added as needed. Also the wear pattern of the Gears 
        should be checked, This can be changed by moving Shims on the two Cross Shaft Bearing Caps 
        from one side or the other. DO NOT remove them completly, if you remove one from one side it 
        must be moved to the other side, this will move the cross shaft gear closer or further away from 
        input gear and keep the correct Bearing Pre-Load. 
 15.    When all Setting are correct remoce housings and caps, use sealer on shims if desired and Re- 
        Check all the Bolts to make sure they are tight. recheck all Settings one more time. 
 16.    Fill Gearbox with Oil, Before deciding Gearbox is full wait long enough for Oil to run down between 
        Shafts and Bearing, Then refill with Oil,  Install all Oil Fill & Vent Plugs, Check for leaks, After 
        running Mower 1/2 to 1 hour check Oil Level and recheck for leaks.

         Ring (item 10) grooves on it, Install the Snap Rings on Input Shaft now. 
 4.      On end of Input Shaft where Gear (item 6) goes there is a Keyway, Install Key (item 
         9) and slide Gear (item 6) down on to Input Shaft till it goes over Key and seats 
         against Snap Ring. 
 5.      Slide Bearing Cone (item 4) down over Input Shaft till it seats against Gear, Slide 
         Bearing Cone (item 4) down over Input Shaft on the other end till it is seated against 
         Snap Ring. Slide a Bearing Cup (item 5) on Shaft till it is over Bearing Cones. 
 6.      Coat ID of Seals (use 2 of item 3) with a light coat of grease and slide them over ends 
         of Cross Shaft (item 2). 
 7.      With Cross Shaft and all the Components lited above install sit it into the Housing Half 
         (item 7) as shown in drawing. 
 8.      Assemble Side Drive Shafts LH & RH,  Install Outer retaining Snap Ring (item 10) 
         onto Side Driver Shaft (item 1). Slide Bearing Cone (item 4) onto Shaft from gear Side 
         of Shaft till it seata against Outer Retaining Ring (item 10). Slide Bearing Cup (item 5) 
         onto Shaft from same end 
 9.      Slide Inner bearing Cup (item 5) onto  Shaft from Gear end, Install Key (item 9) into 
         Keyway of Shaft and install Gear (item 6) over Key, Install Snap Ring (item 10) on shaft 
         to retain Gear. Coat ID of Seal (item 3) with light coat of grease and slide it onto Shaft 
         from outer end. 
  10.    Sit Side Drive Shaft (item 1) with Bearings, Gear, Snap Rings and Seal installed into 
         Housing as shown in drawing. Do this for LH & RH Shaft. Make sure that these 
         assemblies are seated down into the Bearing Cup and Seal areas completly. 
  11.    Housing Halves Assemble. Useing a good Gasket Forming Material install Top Half 
         of Housing (item 8) down onto Lower Half (item 7), Make sure that Housing goes down 
         with out being forced. DO NOT FORCE Housing half together, If they will not slide

                        Assembly Instructions 

 12.    With Halves together install the Bolts (item 12 Not Shown in Drawing) into Housing, 
        Tighten these in a Alternating circular Pattern and in increments that will tighten the 
        two halved together slowly and evenly Continue this till the two halves are bolted 
        together, Inspect them to be sure 
 13.    Install Bottom Plug (item 11 into Bottom Housing. 
 14.    Check Shafts for end play and Gear Back-Lash, There is NO Adjustments on this 
        Gearbox for Shaft End PLay or Gear Back Lash, The Housings have been Machind to 
        allow the proper tolerences. If Setting are not in Tolerence Assembly needs to recheck 
        and Also Housing condition needs to be reinspected. 
 15.    Fill Gearbx with Oil, If every thing is correct Fill Gearbox with oil. DO NOT  Fill with 
        Oil above Suggested Oil Level . Wait  awhile  and let Gearbox sit to have time for Oil 
        to run through and intoOuter  Bearings, Then recheck Oil Level. There is NO Oil Level 
        Plug on this Gearbox. The Best way to check OIl level is with a srew Driver, Through 
        opening for top Plug insert screw driver and use it like a Dip Stick. The Oil Level for 
        this Gearbox is 1/2 the Height of the Gearbox Housing from Bottom to Top. ALWAYS 
        recheck Oil Level after running  Mower 1/2 to 1 hour. Inspect Seals for leaking after 
        filling with Oil and after running 1/2 to 1 hour.

         Housing from the rear through rear Bearing opening on center and left wing Gearbox, from the 
         front on Right wing Gearbox. Slide shaft guiding it through input Gear. slide Shaft in till External 
         Clip is against Gear. 
 9.      Install Rear Input Bearing Cone (#00755615 Cup & Cone) into Rear of Main Housing till it is 
         against External Clip on Shaft.  Install Bearing Cup (#00755615 Cup & Cone) into rear of main 
         housing, Install Shims (#00755619) in against Bearing Cup try to use the same amount of 
         shims as were removed. Install Internal Clip (#00755618) into Main Housing against Shims. DO 
         NOT install any Seals at this time. Install Front Bearing Cone (#00755615 Cup & Cone) onto 
         Input Shaft from the front till they are against Input Gear. Install Shims against Bearing Cup, 
         Install Internal Clip (#00755618) into front of Main Housing against Shims. DO NOT install any 
         Seals at this time. 
 10.     Check Bearing Pre-Load (should be 14" to 16" pounds of rolling Torque) and Gear Back Lash 
         between Blade Shaft Gear and Input Gear (should have .017" to .019" back Lash) If it is not 
         correct, Add or remove shims from Input Shaft Bearings will change Bearing Pre-load,  Move 
         Shim from one side of input Bearing to other to Get Correct Back Lash, It may be required to 
         add or remove shims from Blade Shaft output Gear to raise or lower it to get correct Back lash. 
         Once all is correct Install Input Seal (#00755616) and Rear Seal Cap (#00755634) then recheck 
         Gear and Bearing settings. Now is the time to install Output seal and lower seal protector, (see

                          Assembly Instructions 

      Assembly Instructions and Installation Part Numbers are for Gearbox 
                                      #00769915  (540  rpm) 

   1.      Install Output Shaft  (Blade Shaft), Shaft, Bearings &  Gear in Main Housing (1) 
   2.      Install Upper Bearing Cup (Item 12 Cup & Cone) into Main Housing (Item 1) from the 
           top, Install Lower Bearing Cup (item 2 Cup & Cone) into Main housing from the bottom. 
   3.      Install the Lower Bearing Cone (item 2 Cup & Cone)) down over Output Shaft. Insert Output 
           Shaft with Bearing Cone on it up through Main Housing from the bottom.  Put Upper Bearing 
           Cone (item 12 Cup & Cone) over Out Put Shaft  and slide down till it bottoms out in upper 
           Bearing Cup. 
   4.      Install Shims (item 13 & 15 a/r) as down over top of Output Shaft, The number of shims 
           required will vary, try to use the same amount as were removed. Install Output Gear (item 
           9) over Output Shaft (item 8), Make sure it is seated against Shim. Screw Slotted Bearing 
           Adjusting Nut (item 10) onto top of Output Shaft. 
   5.      Tighten Bearing Adjusting Nut (item 10) above Gear till Bearings have 14" to 16" pounds 
           of rolling Torque then Lock Nut with Cotter Pin (item 11). 
   6.      Install Output Seal (item 3), Coat ID of Seal with light coat of grease. Seal Protector welds 
            to Blade Hub on this style Gearbox., Check Bearing Pre-load Again. Output Shaft Should 
            have NO end play inward or outward. and Bearing MUST be set at a rolling Torque. 
   7.      Install Input Shaft, Shaft, Bearings & Gear into Main Housing (item 1) 
   8.      With Gearbox Main Housing laying on its Back Side. Install Inner Input Bearing Cup (item 
           12 Cup & Cone) into inside of Main Housing. Slide Inner Bearing Cone (item 12 Cup & Cone) 
           into Inner Bearing Cup, Lay Shims (item 13 & 15 a/r) on top of inner Bearing Cone. Lay Input 
           Gear (item 16) in Housing against Shims and inner Bearing Cone. This can be tricky as 
           inner Bearing Cone, Shims and Input Gear ID must line up so Input Shaft (item 30) can drop 
           through them. 
   9.      Slide Sleeve (item 31 Long Sleeve) down on Input Shaft, Slide Outer Bearing Cone (item 
           12 Cup & Cone) down against Long Sleeve (item 31) 
   10.     Install Outer Bearing Cup (Item 12 Cup & Cone) into front Bearing Cover (item 24), 
           Using Shims (Item 20, 21 & 22 a/r) qaunity as required on Front Bearing Cover, Tighten 
           Bolts in front cover. 
   11.     Check Bearing Pre-Load (should be 14" to 16" pounds of rolling Torque), Change the 
           Bearing Pre-Load by adding or removeing Shims (item 20, 21 & 22) from front Bearing 
           Cover, When Bearing Pre-load is correct go on to Gear Back-Lash between Blade Shaft 
           Gear and Input Gear (should have .017" to .019" back Lash) , Change Gear Back Lash by 
           adding or removeing Gear Shims (item 13 & 15) BUT it is important to make sure what ever 
           you add or remove the same thickness must be changed on Input Bearing Cover shims 
           to keep Bearing Pre-Load correct. in some cases it will be required to change the Shims 
            (item 13 & 15) on Output gear to raise or lower Gear.

                          Assembly Instructions 

     Assembly Instructions and Installation Part Numbers are for Gearbox 
                                      #00769921  (540  rpm) 

   1.      Install Output Shaft  (Blade Shaft), Shaft, Bearings &  Gear in Main Housing (1) 
  2.       Install Upper Bearing Cup (Item 12 Cup & Cone) into Main Housing (Item 1) from the 
          top, Install Lower Bearing Cup (item 2 Cup & Cone) into Main housing from the bottom. 
   3.      Install the Lower Bearing Cone (item 2 Cup & Cone)) down over Output Shaft. Insert Output 
           Shaft with Bearing Cone on it up through Main Housing from the bottom.  Put Upper Bearing 
           Cone (item 12 Cup & Cone) over Out Put Shaft  and slide down till it bottoms out in upper 
           Bearing Cup. 
  4.       Install Shims (item 13 & 15 a/r) as down over top of Output Shaft, The number of shims 
           required will vary, try to use the same amount as were removed. Install Output Gear (item 
           9) over Output Shaft (item 8), Make sure it is seated against Shim. Screw Slotted Bearing 
          Adjusting Nut (item 10) onto top of Output Shaft. 
   5.     Tighten Bearing Adjusting Nut (item 10) above Gear till Bearings have 14" to 16" pounds 
           of rolling Torque then Lock Nut with Cotter Pin (item 11). 
   6.      Install Output Seal (item 3), Coat ID of Seal with light coat of grease. Seal Protector welds 
           to Blade Hub on this style Gearbox., Check Bearing Pre-load Again. Output Shaft Should 
           have NO end play inward or outward. and Bearing MUST be set at a rolling Torque. 
   7.      Install Input Shaft, Shaft, Bearings & Gear into Main Housing (item 1) 
   8.     With Gearbox Main Housing laying on its Back Side. Install Inner Input Bearing Cup (item 
           12 Cup & Cone) into inside of Main Housing. Slide Inner Bearing Cone (item 12 Cup & Cone) 
           into Inner Bearing Cup, Lay Shims (item 13 & 15 a/r) on top of inner Bearing Cone. Lay Input 
           Gear (item 16) in Housing against Shims and inner Bearing Cone. This can be tricky as 
           inner Bearing Cone, Shims and Input Gear ID must line up so Input Shaft (item 30) can drop 
          through them. 
  9.       Slide Sleeve (item 31 Long Sleeve) down on Input Shaft, Slide Outer Bearing Cone (item 
           12 Cup & Cone) down against Long Sleeve (item 31) 
   10.     Install Outer Bearing Cup (Item 12 Cup & Cone) into front Bearing Cover (item 24), 
           Using Shims (Item 20, 21 & 22 a/r) qaunity as required on Front Bearing Cover, Tighten 
           Bolts in front cover. 
   11.     Check Bearing Pre-Load (should be 14" to 16" pounds of rolling Torque), Change the 
           Bearing Pre-Load by adding or removeing Shims (item 20, 21 & 22) from front Bearing 
           Cover, When Bearing Pre-load is correct go on to Gear Back-Lash between Blade Shaft 
           Gear and Input Gear (should have .017" to .019" back Lash) , Change Gear Back Lash by 
           adding or removeing Gear Shims (item 13 & 15) BUT it is important to make sure what ever 
          you add or remove the same thickness must be changed on Input Bearing Cover shims 
          to keep Bearing Pre-Load correct. in some cases it will be required to change the Shims 
           (item 13 & 15) on Output gear to raise or lower Gear.

           in to the Main Housing (item 6). Make sure that all components are slid in as far as they 
           will go. Using Lower Bearing Cap Shim Gaskets (item 14 & 15) DO NOT put Gasket 
           Sealer on Gaskets yet & DO NOT install lower Seal. Fit Bearing cap with Gasket 
           Shims (item 14 & 15 down over Output Shaft. Add or remove Gasket Shims to Set 
           Bearing Pre-Load in Output Shaft Bearings, Set Bearing Pre-Load from 14 to 16 inch 
           lbs of rolling torque. 
   5.      When Finished with Step 4 go on to installing Input Shaft or if only replacing  Out put 
           shaft go on to set Gear Back-Lash Step 9. 
   6.      Install Input Shaft & Gear.  Install Inner Input Shaft Bearing (item 8) into back of Main 
           Housing (item 6), make sure bearing is seated completly into Housing. 
   7.      Install Retaining Ring  (item 3) onto input Shaft (item 5), this is the one nearest the 
           middle of the Shaft (Note there are three grooves here make sure to install it in correct 
           one). Slide Input Gear (item 2) down onto input Shaft ( item 5) till it is seated against 
           Retaining Ring (item 3). Slide Input Gear Spacer (item 1) down over Shaft till it seat 
           against Input Gear. Slide Outer Input Bearing (item 8) down over Shaft till it seats 
           against Input Gear. 
   8.      Install Shims (item 7) onto inner Brg end of Input Shaft, then Slide shaft w/ components 
           into Gearbox Main Housing. Using Gasket/ Shims (item 23 Don't use gasket sealer or 
           Install Input seal at this time) slide Input Bearing Cap (item 24) on over Input Shaft,

        vise versa  will change Bearing Back lash (Note moving Shims from front to back will not change 
        Bearing Preload BUT removing or adding them will),    It may be required to add or remove shims 
        from Blade Shaft output Gear to raise or lower it to get correct Back-lash. Once all is correct Coat 
        all Seal ID with light coat of grease. Install Input Seal (3) and Rear Seal Cap (item 17) then recheck 
        Gear and Bearing settings. Now is the time to install Output seal (item 12) and lower seal protector 
        (item 11), 
11.     Install Top Cover (item 20) now using a good qaulity of Form-a-gasket material,  or fill Gearbox 
        with Oil  (see step 12) then install Topcover, Install Vent Plug / Dip Stick (item 19) in to top Cover. 
12.     When this has been Done fill Gearbox with Oil, Before deciding Gearbox is full wait long enough 
        for Oil to run down between Output Shaft Bearing, Then refill with Oil, install Top Cover (using 
        Sealer for Gasket),  Oil Plugs and check for leaks, After running Mower 1/2 to 1 hour check Oil Level 
        and recheck for leaks. 

  NOTE:          The Following Gearboxes will assemble the same as the above 
                 with very minor differences, some componet numbers and the 
                 location of the Input gear.

                                     GEARBOX 
                                  P/N 02978514 
                       Assembly Instructions 

        Installation Part Numbers are for Gearbox #02978514 (540 RPM) 

   1.     Install Center Input / Output Shaft (item 14) , with Bearings, Gear and components 
          as shown in Drawing  into Main Housing (Item 9), install Input shaft before installing 
          Output Shafts to Wings,  Notice Item 12, these are Shim Washers (Compensating 
          Rings) to keep end play out of Shaft. there may be one ore more used. DO NOT 
          INSTALL ANY SEALS TILL GEARBOX IS COMPLETLY ASSEMBLED ! Before you 
          install the seals check the openings for burrs or scratches that will damage or prevent 
          the OD of the seal from sealing. Remove any Burrs and fill scratch with good gasket 
          Sealer 
   2.     Install Snap Ring (Item 10) in Back of Housing (Item 9), this will retain Rear bearing 
          (item 16) DO NOT install Rear Seal (item 11) at this time.  Install Front Shims (item 
          12), Qty use same as was removed as this amount can vary. Slide rear Bearing (item 
          16) into housing (item 9) this can be done from inside. Push Bearing in till it seats 
          against the Shims & Snap Ring (items 10 & 12). 
   3.     Holding Input Gear (item 17) into Gearbox Housing (item 9) from the top slide the Input 
          Shaft (item 14) into the Housing from the front. Slide Shaft through Gear and Rear 
          Bearing. 
   4.     Install Front Bearing (item 13) on input Shaft from the front. Slide Bearing till it goes 
          into Geabox Housing and seats against Shoulder on Input Shaft. Install Shims (item 
          12) using quanity that will will allow end play to be removed, This is a trial & error 
          method because you will need to install Snap Ring (item 10) to check then remove it 
          to add or remove Shims. These are ball Bearings so they will not have Pre-Load. 
          DO NOT install Front Seal (item 11) at this time. 
   5.     Install Output Shaft to Side Drives, The Left & Right Shafts will install the Same using 
          the same Part Numbers. it is best to install Parts for both Side Drive Shafts at same 
          time. 
   6.     Looking down into gearbox Housing (item 9)  you can see the inner casting for the Inner 
          Bearing (item 7), There will be adjusting Shims (item 8) that need to be installed here 
          before Bearing is. The quanity of Shims will vary, Try the same amount as was 
          removed here. Install the inner Bearing (item 7) into Housing. 
   7.     Side Output Shaft (item 1) has a Snap Ring Grove on it near outer Bearing (item 
          5)area. Slide Outer Bearing (item 5) onto Side Shaft (item 1) till it seats against 
          Shoulder on Shaft. Install Snap Ring (item 22) on Shaft next to Bearing. 
   8.     Take the Gear for Side Drive (item 6) and slide it down into Gearbox from the Top, With 
          the side Drive Gear in position against the Input Gear (item 17), take the Side drive 
          Shaft (item 1) and Slide it through the Housing from the out side, rotating Shaft as you 
          push it through to align Splines on shaft with spline in Gear. Push the Shaft in till the 
          Bearing is into Housing and the shoulder on Shaft seats against inner Bearing.

         -Lash and Seating of gears can be changed  by moving Shims (item 12) on center 
         Shaft and  (item 8) on Side Drive Shafts. this is a trial & error Method of adding & 
         removing Shims. Do This till the Gear Back Lash is .016" to .019" and Gear seating 
         is even Heal to Toe. 
  11.    Coat all Shafts & ID of seals with alight coat of Grease before installing Seals. Install 
         Seals Now, if the openings for the seals have not been inspected as explained in Step 
         1, do so now before installing Seals. 
  12.    Install top cover using Gasket sealer,  Fill Gearbox with oil. Gearbox can be filled with 
         oil before top cover is installed if wanted. DO NOT  Fill with Oil above Oil Level Plug. 
         Always check for Oil Leaks befor Running Mower and Always recheck Oil Level,

        of Main Housing (item 1) and through input Gear (item 21) till shaft sticks out the Back of Main 
        Housing.  Slide rear Input Bearing Cone (item 2) with smaller end pointing out onto rear of input 
        shaft till it seats against Gear (item 21) . Slide rear Bearing Cup (item 2) onto rear of input shaft 
        and into Main Housing till it is seated 
        against Beaing Cone. Install Shims (item 6) into front of main housing  till they are against Bearing 
        Cup. Install Snap ring (item 5). DO NOT INSTALL ANY SEALS YET 
9.      Install Shims (item 16) onto front of Input Shaft and install front Input Bearing Cone (item 2) into 
        front of Main Housing till it is against Shoulder / Shims on Shaft,  Install Bearing Cup (item 2) into 
        front of main housing, Install Shims (item 6) in against Bearing Cup try to use the same amount 
        of shims as were removed. Install Internal Clip (item 5) into Main Housing against Shims. DO 
        NOT install any Seals at this time.  Check Bearing Preload now, it should be 14" to 16" lbs of rolling

10.     Check Gear Back-Lash between Blade Shaft Gear and Input Gear (should have .017" to .019" 
        back Lash) If it is not correct, moving shims (item 6) on Input Shaft Bearingsfrom front to back or 
        vise versa  will change Bearing Back lash (Note moving Shims from front to back will not change 
        Bearing Preload BUT removing or adding them will),    It may be required to add or remove shims 
        from Blade Shaft output Gear to raise or lower it to get correct Back-lash. Once all is correct Coat 
        all Seal ID with light coat of grease. Install Input Seal (3) and Rear Seal Cap (item 17) then recheck 
        Gear and Bearing settings. Now is the time to install Output seal (item 12) and lower seal protector

                                  P/N 02978968 
                       Assembly Instructions 

      Installation Part Numbers are for Gearbox #002978968 (1000 RPM) 

   1.     Install Center Input / Output Shaft (item 14) , with Bearings, Gear and components 
          as shown in Drawing  into Main Housing (Item 9), install Input shaft before installing 
          Output Shafts to Wings,  Notice Item 12, these are Shim Washers (Compensating 
          Rings) to keep end play out of Shaft. there may be one ore more used. DO NOT 
          INSTALL ANY SEALS TILL GEARBOX IS COMPLETLY ASSEMBLED ! Before you 
          install the seals check the openings for burrs or scratches that will damage or prevent 
          the OD of the seal from sealing. Remove any Burrs and fill scratch with good gasket 
          Sealer 
   2.     Install Snap Ring (Item 10) in Back of Housing (Item 9), this will retain Rear bearing 
          (item 16) DO NOT install Rear Seal (item 11) at this time.  Install Front Shims (item 
          12), Qty use same as was removed as this amount can vary. Slide rear Bearing (item 
          16) into housing (item 9) this can be done from inside. Push Bearing in till it seats 
          against the Shims & Snap Ring (items 10 & 12). 
   3.     Holding Input Gear (item 17) into Gearbox Housing (item 9) from the top slide the Input 
          Shaft (item 14) into the Housing from the front. Slide Shaft through Gear and Rear 
          Bearing. 
   4.     Install Front Bearing (item 13) on input Shaft from the front. Slide Bearing till it goes 
          into Geabox Housing and seats against Shoulder on Input Shaft. Install Shims (item 
          12) using quanity that will will allow end play to be removed, This is a trial & error 
          method because you will need to install Snap Ring (item 10) to check then remove it 
          to add or remove Shims. These are ball Bearings so they will not have Pre-Load. 
          DO NOT install Front Seal (item 11) at this time. 
   5.     Install Output Shaft to Side Drives, The Left & Right Shafts will install the Same using 
          the same Part Numbers. it is best to install Parts for both Side Drive Shafts at same 
          time. 
   6.     Looking down into gearbox Housing (item 9)  you can see the inner casting for the Inner 
          Bearing (item 7), There will be adjusting Shims (item 8) that need to be installed here 
          before Bearing is. The quanity of Shims will vary, Try the same amount as was 
          removed here. Install the inner Bearing (item 7) into Housing. 
   7.     Side Output Shaft (item 1) has a Snap Ring Grove on it near outer Bearing (item 
          5)area. Slide Outer Bearing (item 5) onto Side Shaft (item 1) till it seats against 
          Shoulder on Shaft. Install Snap Ring (item 22) on Shaft next to Bearing. 
   8.     Take the Gear for Side Drive (item 6) and slide it down into Gearbox from the Top, With 
          the side Drive Gear in position against the Input Gear (item 17), take the Side drive 
          Shaft (item 1) and Slide it through the Housing from the out side, rotating Shaft as you 
          push it through to align Splines on shaft with spline in Gear. Push the Shaft in till the 
          Bearing is into Housing and the shoulder on Shaft seats against inner Bearing.

         -Lash and Seating of gears can be changed  by moving Shims (item 12) on center 
         Shaft and  (item 8) on Side Drive Shafts. this is a trial & error Method of adding & 
         removing Shims. Do This till the Gear Back Lash is .016" to .019" and Gear seating 
         is even Heal to Toe. 
  11.    Coat all Shafts & ID of seals with alight coat of Grease before installing Seals. Install 
         Seals Now, if the openings for the seals have not been inspected as explained in Step 
         1, do so now before installing Seals. 
  12.    Install top cover using Gasket sealer,  Fill Gearbox with oil. Gearbox can be filled with 
         oil before top cover is installed if wanted. DO NOT  Fill with Oil above Oil Level Plug. 
         Always check for Oil Leaks befor Running Mower and Always recheck Oil Level, 
         Inspect Seals for Leaking, Excessive end play in Shaft after running  Mower 1/2 to 1

                                          P/N 4800 
                         Assembly Instructions 

   1.      Installing Input Shaft and Gear,  Install Front Bearing (item 3) into Main Housing 
           (item 1) Bearing will install from back side of Housing. 
   2.      Install Key (item 2) into Input Shaft, Slide input Gear (item 6) on to Shaft from front Side. 
   3.      Install Input Seal into Main Housing from the Out Side or Seal can be installed later if 
           wanted, If Seal is installed coat ID of Seal with light coat of Grease and also coat area 
           on Shaft where Seal contacts Shaft. 
   4.      Drop Input Shaft with Gear on it through Seal and Main Housing from the Back of Main 
           Housing. Use caution not to damage Input Seal if it has been installed 
   5.      Insert Rear Cover O-Ring (item 18) into Housing and coat it with a light coat of grease. 
           Push Rear Cover  (item 16) into Housing, Cover is held in place by Shoulder Ring (item 
           17) which is installed now. 
   6.      Installing Output Shaft (item 13) , with Bearings and componts as shown in Drawing 
           into Main Housing (Item 1), install Input shaft before installing Output Shaft 
   7.      Install components onto Output Shaft (item 13), First slide the Shims (item 12) at top 
           of Output Shaft under Gear on use the same quanity as was removed, Install Top 
           Bearing (item 3) on till it seats against Shims. 
   8.      Slide Lower Bearing Spacer (item 7) on Output Shaft, This Spacer has the OD same 
           as the Bearings so it will be loose on Shaft.  Put Lower Bearing (item 3) on Shaft til it 
           seats against Bearing Spacer. 
   9.      Install more Shims (item 12) on output shaft, Use same Quanity as was taken off. 
           Install the External Snap ring (item 9) onto Output Shaft. 
   10      The Out out Shaft, Bearings, Shims, Bearing Spacer and Snap Ring  should be all one 
           assembly now.  Slide this assembly up into Main Housing from the Bottom, It may be 
           rquired to move Bearing spacer side to side to keep it lined up. Slide assembly in till 
           upper Bearing bottoms out in Housing. 
   11.     Install Lower Internal Snap Ring (item 8) into lower end of Main Housing, This retains 
           Output Shaft and components. DO NOT install lower Seal at this Time. 
   12.     Check Shaft for end Play and Gear Back-Lash, there should be no end play, If there 
           is install more Shims (item 12) on Shaft, If Shaft is to tight use less Shims. Gear Back- 
           Lash should be .016" to .019" if it is not then move Shims (item 12) from Top  to Bottom 
           or Bottom to Top, Where ever they are moved from they will have to go to the other end 
           to keep End Play correct. 
   13.     Install Lower Seal ( Item 11 Dust Shield), Coat Seal ID with light coat of grease, Install 
           Shoulder Ring (item 10) 
   14.     Fill Gearbox with oil. DO NOT  Fill with Oil above Oil Level Plug. Wait  a while  let 
           Gearbox sit and have time for Oil to run down into lower Bearings and recheck Oil 
           Level. ALWAYS recheck Oil Level after running  Mower 1/2 to 1 hour. Inspect Seals 
           for leaking after filling with Oil and after running 1/2 to 1 hour.

which G/B you have is by looking were the Shaft goes through the G/B Housing, 
The Old Style had Bolt on Caps Here and the new style will not.

                        Assembly Instructions 
 Asy instructions Gearbox # 700493 (540 RPM Used Jan. 1991 & Down) 

 1.      Install  Output Shaft & Pinion Gear into Main Housing (# 100228) 
 2.      Install Snap Ring (# 000331) into Main Housing (#100228). Install Inner Output Bearing Cone 
         (#000329) on Output Shaft (#100225). Install Inner Bearing Cup (#000327) down over Bearing 
         Cone, Make Note of Shims (#100236 = .002",  #100237 = .004",  #100238 = .006", #100239 
         = .012" & #100240 = .020") quanity will be as required, try to put in the same amount as taken 
         out. These shims will be on either side of Inner Output Shaft Bearing Cup. Slide out put shaft 
         into housing with Inner Bearing Cup with Shims. Slide Bearing Spacer (#100241) in till it 
         bottoms out against inner Bearing Cup, Insert Outer Bearing Cup (#000327) into Main Housing, 
         Slide Outer Bearing Cone (#000328) over Shaft till it seats against Outer Cup (#000327). Install 
         Snap Ring (#000330) onto output shaft next to outer Bearing Cup. 
 3.      Install Output Seal (#100055) into Seal Housing (#100707), Install Seal Housing using Shims 
         (#100232 = .020"), (#10233 = .007"), (#100234 = .005"), (#100235 = .002") quanity as required 
         onto Main Housing over Output Shaft. Tighten Bolts (#000601) and check Bearing Pre-Load, 
         Should be from 14" to 16" pounds of rolling torque. Shaft should NOT have end play, If you have 
         end play it will be required to rearrange shims at Inner Bearing Cup or at Bearing cover till 
         settings are right. 
 4.      Install Input Shaft & Gear into Main Housing: 
 5.      Install front Bearing Cone (#000328) and rear Bearing Cone (#000328) onto Input Shaft and 
         Gear Asy. (#700492) Gear & Shaft can only be replaced as an Assembly, Gear cannot be 
         pressed off of Shaft. Install Input Seal (#100054) into Input Bearing Cover (#100230), Install 
         outer Bearing Cup (#000327) into Main Housing.  Using Shims (#100232 = .020"), (#100233 
         = .007"), (#100234 = .005"), (#100235 = .002") quanity as required (try same quanity as taken 
         off) install Input Bearing Cover on front of Main Housing tightening 4 retaining bolts. 
 6.      Install Rear Housing Cover (#100229) on rear of Main Housing, Use Gasket Sealer on this 
         cover it will not use a Gasket, If a Gasket is wanted Gasket # 00769800 can be used. Install 
         Rear Bearing Cup (#000327) into rear Housing Cover. Using Shims (#100232 = .020", 
         #100233 = .007",  #100234 = .005" & #100235 = .002") quanity as required (try same quanity 
         as taken off) install Rear Bearing Cap (#100231) on Rear Housing Cover, tightening 4 retaining 
         bolts. This will set Bearing Pre-Load, It should be at 14" to 16" pounds of rolling torque. It may 
         be required to remove shims from Bearing Caps or add Shims. 
 7.      Set Gear Back Lash with Bearing Cap Shims, Gear Back Lash should be from .014" to .017", 
         This is very critical.  By moving shims from front cover to back cover or vice versa gear is 
         moved inward or outward, DO NOT add or delete shims as this will change your Bearing Pre- 
         Load. 
 8.      Fill Gearbox with Oil till Oil flows out of Oil Level hole. Install Oil Level Plug (#000054) and Oil 
         Fill Plug (#000055).  Check all Seals and Gasket areas for leaks. After Running Mower 1/2 to 
         1 hour recheck Oil Level and check for any leaks. 
 HELP ! 
 There were TWO GEARBOXES used that looked very much the same but they are not, The earlier model (# 700493) 
 till approx Jan. 1991 , this gearbox can be identified by the round 4 bolt cover at the input shaft and small 4 bolt 
 round cover in the middle of the larger 8 bolt cover in the rear, There is a 4 bolt cover at the Output Shaft also. These 
 covers are to adjust the Bearing preload and Gear backlash. This gearbox will also have Roller Bearings on Input 
 Shaft and Output Shaft. The Later Type (# 702673) Feb 1991 & up has Ball Bearings on Input shaft and will replace 
 the # 700493 G/B as an assembly, Parts WILL NOT interchange between these two gearboxes.

NOTE:  This G/B Asy (P/N 702673) Can replace earlier style (P/N 700493) as 
an Asy but parts WILL NOT interchange between them. The easiest way to tell 
which G/B you have is by looking were the Shaft goes through the G/B Housing, 
The Old Style had Bolt on Caps Here and the new style will not.

 1.      Install Output Shaft & Pinion Gear into Main Housing (# 002516). 
 2.       Install Snap Ring (# 00754752) into Main Housing (#002516). Install Shims (#00753222) on 
         Output Shaft next to Gear. Install Inner Output Bearing Cone (#001722 Cup & Cone) on Output 
         Shaft (#001718). Install Inner Bearing Cup (#001722 Cup & Cone) down over Bearing Cone, 
         Slide out put shaft into housing. Insert Snap Ring (#00754752) into Main Housing. Slide Bearing 
         Spacer (#001716) in till it bottoms out against Snap Ring.

         Spacer, Slide Outer Bearing Cone (#00754757 Cup & Cone) over Shaft till it seats against Outer 
         Cup. Install Tabbed Lock Washer (#001720) onto output shaft next to outer Bearing Cone, Make 
         sure Inner Tab of locking washer is in keyway of Shaft. Install Notched Locking Nut (#001717) 
         by screwing it onto Output Shaft, Tighten Nut till Bearing Pre-Load is set at 14' to 16" lbs. of 
         rolling Torque. When Bearing Pre-Load is correct, DON'T BEND Locking Washer Tabs into 
         Notches on Locking Nut and DON'T INSTALL OUTPUT SEAL AT THIS TIME, this is important. 
 4.       Install  Input  Shaft  & Gear  into Main Housing (# 002516) 
 5.       Install front Bearing (#00754459) into Main Housing (#002516).  Using Shims (#00754761), 
         quanity as required (try same quanity as taken out) install Snap ring (#00754752) into Main

         wanted Gasket # 00769800 will fit and can be used for rear cover. 
 7.      Set Bearing Pre-load on Input Shaft to remove end Play Only, this is because outer Bearing is 
         a Ball Bearing. Do this by adding or removing Shims between Front input Bearing and Snap 
          Ring. 
 8.      Set Gear Back Lash with Shims on output shaft next to output Pinion Gear, Add or remove 
         shims, Gear Back Lash should be from .016" to .019", This is very critical. after Gear Back Lash 
         is correct reset Bearing Pre-Load on Output shaft. 
 9.       Install Input Seal (#0017240 and Output Seal (#001719), Inspect all opening for seals to make 
         sure there are no Burrs or Scratches to damage seals when installed, Always coat ID of Seals 
         with light coat of grease this helps to prevent damage to ID of seals when being installed. 
  10.     Fill Gearbox with Oil till Oil flows out of Oil Level hole. Install Oil Level plug and Oil Fill Plug.  Check 
         all Seals and Gasket areas for leaks. After Running Mower for 1/2 to 1 hour recheck Oil Level 
         Looking for any leaks. 

 HELP ! 
 This Later Gearbox  # 702673 will only have a large 8 bolt cover on rear of gearbox without the small cover in center 
 of it.  Thers is a Ball bearing on front of input shaft the old style had all Roller Bearings, Input Seals are different, 
 Older Gearbox seal is a bit larger than the later, The later type used a snap ring behind seal to hold bearings in where 
 the earlier type had bolt on covers. If you have these bolt on covers see G/B # 700493 
 These gearboxes DID NOT use vent plugs at all.
