EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS 
'04-'06: 
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) require manufacturers to certify that their motorcycles comply with applicable exhaust emissions standards during their useful life, when operated and maintained according to the instructions provided, and that motorcycles built after January 1, 1983 comply with applicable noise emission standards for one year or 6,000 km (3.730 miles) after the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser, when operated and maintained according to the instructions provided. Compliance with the terms of the Distributor's Limited Warranty for Honda Motorcycle Emission Control Systems is necessary in order to keep the emissions system warranty in effect. 
After '06: 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) require that off-road 
motorcycle comply with applicable exhaust emissions standards during its useful life, when operated and maintained 
according to the instruction provided. 

SOURCE OF EMISSIONS 
The combustion process produces carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons. Control of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen is very important because, under certain conditions, they react to form photochemical smog when subjected to sunlight. Carbon monoxide does not react in the same way, but is toxic. 
Honda Motor Co., ltd. utilizes various systems to reduce carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and hydrocarbon. 
EXHAUST EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM (After '06) 
The exhaust emission control system includes a secondary air injection system and lean carburetor settings, no adjustments should be made except for high altitude setting and idle speed adjustment with the throttle stop screw. The exhaust emission control system is separate from the crankcase emission control system. 
CRANKCASE EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM 
The engine is equipped with a closed crankcase system to prevent discharging crankcase emissions into the atmosphere. Blow-by gas is returned to the combustion chamber through the air cleaner and carburetor. 
AIR CLEANI'R 


~FRESH AIR _ BLOW-BY GAS 
1-33 


EXHAUST EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM (PULSE SECONDARY AIR INJECTION SYSTEM): 
'04 -'06 California type, After '06 
The exhaust emission control system includes of a secondary air supply system which introduces filtered air into the exhaust gases in the exhaust port. Fresh air is drawn into the exhaust port whenever there is a negative pressure pulse in the exhaust system. This charge of fresh air promotes burning of the unburned exhaust gases and changes a considerable amount of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide into relatively harmless carbon dioxide and water vapor. 
This model has a pulse secondary air injection (PAIR) control valve. A PAIR check valve prevents reverse air flow through the system. The PAIR control valve reacts to high intake manifold vacuum and will cut off the supply of fresh air during engine deceleration, thereby preventing afterburn in the exhaust system. 
No adjustment to the PAIR system should be made, although periodic inspection of the components is recommended.

SERVICING THE HONDA (After '06) 
U.S.A. Only 
Mainlenance, replacement or repair of the emission conlrol devices and systems may be performed by any motorcycte repair establishment or individual using parts that are иcertified" 10 EPA standards. 
PROHIBITED ACTIONS (After '06) 
The following prohibitions apply to everyone with respect to the engines emission control system. 
You may not remove or disable any device or element of design that may affect an engine's emission levels. This restriction applies before and after the engine in placed in service. 
Vehicles that are used only for competition are exempt from this prohibition. 
NOISE EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM 
TAMPERING WITH THE NOISE CONTROL SYSTEM IS PROHIBITED: U.S. Federal laws prohibit, or Canadian provincial laws may prohibit the following acts or the causing thereof: !1) The removal or rendering inoperative by any person, other than for purposes of maintenance, repair or replacement, of any device or element of design incorporated into any new vehicle for the purpose of noise control prior to its sale or delivery to the ultimate purchaser or while it is in use; or !2) the use of the vehicle after such device or element of design has been removed or rendered inoperative by any person. 
AMONG THOSE ACTS PRESUMED TO CONSTITUTE TAMPERING ARE THE FOLLOWING ACTS: 
1. 	
Removal of, or puncturing the muffler, baffles, header pipes or any other component which conducts exhaust gases. 

2. 	
Removal of, or puncturing of any part of the intake system. 

3. 	
Lack of proper maintenance. 

4. 	
Replacing any moving parts of the vehicle, or parts of the exhaust or intake system, with parts other then those speciГfied by the manufacturer. 


REBUILT ENGINE (After '06) 
When you rebuild your engine including a major overhaul in which you replace the engine's pistons or power assemblies or make other changes that significantly increase the service life of the engine. your Honda will continue to comply with all emissions regulations if you: 
-Make sure you are technically qualified to rebuild the engine and have the proper tools -Use only Genuine Honda parts or equivalents -Make sure to maintain all specifications as described in this Service Manual

system is serviced . 
Ћ 	Do not mix different types of fluid, as they are 
not compatible with each other. 
Ћ 	Do not allow foreign material to enter the system when filling the reservoir. 
FLUID LEVEL INSPECTION 
When the fluid level is low, check the brake pads for wear (page 3-27). 
A low fluid level may be due to wear of the brake pads. If the brake pads are worn, the caliper piston is pushed out, and this accounts for a low reservoir level. If the brake pads are not worn and the fluid level is low, check the entire system for leaks (page 3-26). 
FRONT BRAKE: 
Turn the handlebar so that the reservoir is level and 
check the front brake fluid level. 
If the level is near the lower level line, check the 
brake pad wear (page 3-27). 

REAR BRAKE: 

Support the motorcycle in an upright position on 
level surface. 
If the level is near the lower level line, check the 
brake pad wear (page 3-27).

Remove any dirt that has accumulated on the botГ
tom of the fork seals. 

Replace damaged components which cannot be 
repaired. 
Tighten all nuts and bolts. 

For fork service (page 13-12). 

Air pressure acts as a progressive spring and affects 
the entire range of fork travel. 

Air is an unstable gas; it increases in pressure as it 
is worked (such as in a fork), so the fork action on 
your CRF will get stiffer as the race progresses. 

Release built-up air pressure from the fork legs after 
practice and between heats. 
Be sure the fork is fully extended with the front tire 
off the ground. 
Loosen the plug bolt fully, then tighten them.

HIGH ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENT (California type only) 
At high altitude, the standard carburetor air-fuel mixture will be too rich. Performance will decrease, and fuel consumption will increase. A very rich mixГture will also foul the spark plug and cause hard starting. Operation at an altitude that differs from that at which this engine was certified, for extended periods of time, may increase emissions. 
High altitude performance can be improved by speГcific modifications to the carburetor. If your cusГtomer always operates the motorcycle at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters), you should perform this carburetor modification. 
Even with carburetor modification, engine horseГpower will decrease about 3.5% for each 1,OOO-foot (300-meter) increase in altitude. The effect of altiГtude on horsepower will be greater than this if no carburetor modification is made. 
This engine, when operated at high altitude with the carburetor modifications for high altitude use, will meet each emission standard throughout its useful life. 
Remove the carburetor (page 5-11). 
Remove the float chamber.

TROUBLESHOOTING 
Ћ 	
Engine top-end problems usually affect engine performance. These problems can be diagnosed by a compression test or by tracing top-end noise with a sounding rod stethoscope. 

Ћ 	
If the performance is poor 8t low speeds, check for white smoke in the crankcase breather hose. If the hose is smoky, check for a seized piston ring. 


Compression too low. hard starting or poor performance at low speed 
Ћ 	Valves: 
-	Incorrect valve adjustment 
-	Burned or bent valves 
-	Incorrect valve timing 
-	Broken valve spring 
-	Uneven valve seating

SERVICE INFORMATION GENERAL 
Ћ 	
Keep grease off the brake pads and disc. 

Ћ 	
A contaminated brake disc or pad reduces stopping power. Discard contaminated pads and clean a contaminated disc with a high quality brake degreasing agent. 

Ћ 	
When servicing the front wheel, fork or steering stem, support the motorcycle using a safety stand or hoist. 

Ћ 	
After front wheel installation, check the brake operation by applying the brake lever. 

Ћ 	
Refer to the brake system information (page 15-3). 

Ћ 	
When using the lock nut wrench, use a 20иinch long deflecting beam type torque wrench. The lock nut wrench increases the torque wrench's leverage, so the torque wrench reading will be less than the torque actually applied to the fork damper. The specification given on this page is actual torque applied to the fork damper, not the reading on the torque wrench when used with the lock nut wrench. The procedure later in the text gives the actual and indicated torque.

SERVICE INFORMATION 
GENERAL 
AWARNING 
Ћ 	
Use only nitrogen to pressurize the shock absorber. The use of an unstable gas can cause a fire or explosion resulting in serious injury. 

Ћ 	
The shock absorber contains nitrogen under high pressure. Do not allow fire or heat near the shock absorber. 

Ћ 	
Before disposal of the shock absorber, release the nitrogen by pressing the valve core. Then remove the valve from the shock absorber. 

Ћ 	
Keep grease off of the brake pads and disk. 

Ћ 	
A contaminated brake disk or pad reduces stopping power. Discard contaminated pads and clean a contaminated disk with a high quality brake degreasing agent. 

Ћ 	
When selVicing the rear wheel, support the motorcycle using a safety stand or hoist. 

Ћ 	
For optimum suspension performance and linkage component service life, the swingarm and shock linkage pivot bearГing (along with related seals and bushings) should be disassembled, cleaned, inspected for wear and lubricated with multi-purpose grease NLGI No.2 (molybdenum disulfide additive) every three races or 7.5 hours of operation. 

Ћ 	
Optional rear wheel sprockets, drive chain, shock springs and spring preload pin spanners are available. Refer to genГeral information (page 1-30\. 

Ћ 	
For brake system information (page 15-3).

SERVICE INFORMATION 
GENERAL 
AWARNING 
Frequent inhalation of brake pad dust, regardless of material composition could be hazardous to your health. 
Ћ 	
Avoid breathing dust particles . 

Ћ 	
Never use an air hose or brush to clean brake assemblies. Use an OSHA-approved vacuum cleaner. 


I 	NOTICE I 
Spilled brake fluid will severely damage instrument lenses and painted surfaces. It is also harmful to some rubber pans. Be careful whenever you remove the reservoir cap; make sure the front reservoir is horizontal first. 
Ћ 	
A contaminated brake disc or pad reduces stopping power. Discard contaminated pads and clean a contaminated disc with high quality brake degreasing agent. 

Ћ 	
Check the brake system by applying the brake lever or pedal after the air bleeding. 

Ћ 	
Never allow contaminants (dirt, water, etc.) to get into an open reservoir. 

Ћ 	
Once the hydraulic system has been opened, or if the brake feels spongy, the system must be bled. 

Ћ 	
Always use fresh DOT 4 brake fluid from a sealed container when servicing the system. Do not mix different types of 

fluid, they may not be compatible. 

Ћ 	
Always check brake operation before riding the motorcycle.

SERVICE INFORMATION 
GENERAL 
AWARNING 
Ћ 	The battery gives off explosive gases; keep sparks, flames and cigarettes away. Provide adequate ventilation when 
charging. 
Ћ 	The battery contains sulfuric acid (electrolyte). Contact with skin or eyes may cause severe burns. Wear protective clothing and a face shield. -If electrolyte gets on your skin, flush with water. -If electrolyte gets in your eyes, flush with water for at least 15 minutes and call a physician immediately. 
Ћ Electrolyte is poisonous. =-J -If swallowed, drink large quantities of water or milk and call your local Poison Control Center or a physician immediately. 
Ћ 	
For extended storage, remove the battery, give il a full charge. and store it in a cool, dry space. 

Ћ 	
For a battery remaining in a stored motorcycle, disconnect the negative battery cable from the battery terminal. 

Ћ 	
The battery sealing caps should not be removed. Attempting to remove the sealing caps from the cells may damage the battery. 

Ћ 	
The maintenance free battery must be replaced when it reaches the end of its service life. 

Ћ 	
The battery can be damaged if overcharged or undercharged, or if left to discharge for a long period. These same conГditions contribute to shortening the life span of the battery. Even under normal use, the performance of the battery deteriorates after 2-3 years. 

Ћ 	
Battery voltage may recover aher battery charging, but under heavy load, battery voltage will drop quickly and eventuГally die out. For this reason, the charging system is often suspected as the problem. Battery overcharge often results from problems in the battery itself, which may appear to be an overcharging symptom. If one of the battery cells is shorted and battery voltage does not increase, the regulator/rectifier supplies excess voltage to the battery. Under these conditions, the electrolyte level goes down quickly. 

Ћ 	
Before troubleshooting the charging system, check for proper use and maintenance of the battery. Check if the battery is frequently under heavy load. 

Ћ 	
The battery will self-discharge when the motorcycle is not in use. For this reason, charge the battery every 2 weeks to prevent sulfation from occurring. 

Ћ 	
Filling a new battery with electrolyte will produce some voltage, but in order to achieve its maximum performance, always charge the battery. Also, the battery life is lengthened when it is initially charged. 

Ћ 	
When checking the charging system, always follow the steps in the troubleshooting flow chart (page 16-5). 


BATTERY CHARGING 
Ћ 	
This model comes with a maintenance free (MF) battery. Remember the following about MF batteries. 
-Use only the electrolyte that comes with the battery. 
-Use all of the electrolyte. 
-Seal the battery properly. 
-Never open the seals after installation. 


Ћ 	
Turn power ON/OFF at the charger, not at the battery terminal. 

Ћ 	
For battery charging, do not exceed the charging current and time specified on the battery. Using excessive current or extending the charging time may damage the battery. 

Ћ 	
Quick charging should only be done in an emergency; slow charging is preferred.

For the following recommendations to be useful, the motorcycle must be adjusted as follows: -Fork: compression damping at standard pOSition, at standard fork oil quantity and viscosity, and air pressure zero. 

-	Shock: nitrogen pressure 981 kPa (10.0 kgf/cm2, 142 psi)' compression and rebound damping stanГdard position, and spring preload adjusted so the bikes sags with rider seated -see Owner's manГual for spring preload adjustment 

Ћ 	
The following recommendations are given in the preferred sequence of adjustment 


Front End Oversteers; It Cuts Too Sharply (such as in sand) 
Ћ 	
Increase the fork oil capacity 

Ћ 	
Use stiffer fork spring 



Front End Understeers; It Washes Out Or Pushes (such as on at tight track with hard ground) 
Ћ 	
Lower fork oil capacity 

Ћ 	
Use softer fork spring 



Front End Hunts At High Speed; It Wanders Under Power 
Ћ 	
Increase the fork oil capacity 

Ћ 	
Increase the shock oil preload 


Front End Shakes Under Heavy Braking 
Ћ 	
Decrease shock preload 

Ћ 	
Increase shock rebound damping 

Ћ 	
Increase the fork oil capacity 



Front End Hops Over Bumps In Smoot" Turns 
Ћ 	
Change the lighter fork oil 

Ћ 	
Decrease the fork oil capacity 

Ћ 	
Decrease fork compression damping 

Ћ 	
Use softer fork spring 



Rear End Hops Over Bumps While Accelerating 
Ћ 	
Decrease shock pre load
