Note: The Assembly Lube provided with the cam gear will be  
used to lubricate the valve lifters in a later operation. Do not  
lubricate the cam shaft bolts as instructed on the assembly lube  
package included with the cam shaft. 

Note: Cam shafts are supplied with varying hardware, all of  
which is acceptable. Use the hardware supplied with the cam  
to attach the cam gear. This may include either: 

        Cam Bolts with integral lock washers. 
        Cam bolts and wavy spring washers.                                   __3.    If tabbed washers were          3

Note: While not common,  slight interference between the cam                         against the bolt heads  
and the connecting rods does occasionally occur. One cause of                        with a flat-blade screw- 
this interference is a raised edge around the numbers stamped                        driver. 
in the shaft of the cam. Lightly polishing these numbers will  
remove the raised edge and eliminate a possible source of  
interference.  

A raised edge around the stamped numbers on the cam can  
sometimes cause interference with the connecting rods.

       machined surfaces (see photo) and to casting slag on the  
       inside of the case which may dislodge  after the engine  
       is in service.

Remove clinging chips and loose slag from the cases interior. 

__2.   If you are painting the case, now is the best time to do  
       so. Mask off all machined surfaces, mating surfaces,  
       and holes before painting. 

       Note: We have had good luck using "Barbecue Black"  
       spray paint on the case and piston barrels.

__1. Using a high-temperature silicone sealant, lightly coat  
     the dowel pin area of the flywheel and place a small bead  
     (1/8" diameter) in the groove near the dowel pin area of  
     the flywheel. 

     Note: The engine assembly DVD may show an O-ring  
     being used instead. The O-ring has been discontinued.   

__2. Install the flywheel on  
     the back of the engine. 

     important: The 8 dowel  
     pins will only align one  
     way. 

     Note: The flywheel may  
     require some effort to  
     get it started and seated  
     on the drive pins. This is  
     normal.

Bolting the engine to the engine mount is shown in detail in  
the "Engine Installation, AeroVee" drawing of your airframe  
plans and on the next page of this manual, however, these few  
notes may save you some time. 

All Airframes 
mount Bushings  
The engine mount bushings will go on the engine mount much  
easier if they lightly lubricated with soapy water. 

Lifting the engine  
When lifting the engine into place care must be taken to make  
sure the pushrod tubes are not damaged. 

installing the mount Bolts  
The head of the mounting bolts may be inserted in either  
direction. 

A typical engine mount and shock-rubber installation. A mini- 
mum of two ACV-Z01-40 washers (1/8" thick total, minimum)  
must be placed against the front bushing. Additional washers  
may be used as needed, and washers may be used behind the  
rear bushings as spacers to shim the thrust line as needed.

Parts Required 
__ Electrical Terminals (not supplied) 
__ Electrical Wire (not supplied) 

Alternator - Regulator Wiring 
__ 1.  Attach the two wires from the alternator to the two outer  
       terminals of the voltage regulator. It does not matter  
       which wire attaches to which terminal. 

__ 2.  Attach an 8 or 10 gauge wire from the center terminal  
       of the voltage regulator to the positive battery terminal. 

__ 3.  If you will be using a tachometer which senses pulses  
       from the alternator, it must be spliced in to one of  
       the wires from the alternator.  Consult the instrument  
       manufacturer's instructions for proper installation and  
       set-up. 

       Note: The 20 amp alternator delivers 6 pulses per revo- 
       lution. 

__ 4.  If the voltage regulator is attached to a non-conductive  
       surface a ground wire needs to be attached between  
       the body of the regulator and an appropriate airframe  
       ground.

AeroVee 2.1 Rev AA. 08/05/2015                                  OIL COOLER INSTALLATION OPTIONS 

The AeroVee can be fitted with two different factory-devel- 
oped oil cooler installations or, in rare circumstances, no oil  
cooler at all. 

Your engine kit was shipped with the AeroConversion-specific  
parts needed for one of the two oil cooler installations detailed  
on the following pages. The oil cooler and some additional  
items such as hardware and fittings must be sourced by each  
builder. Each section begins with a list of items that will be  
needed to complete the installation. In many cases these are  
common parts which may be sourced locally from automotive- 
supply stores or hardware stores. 

Additionally, both Wicks and Aircraft Spruce offer AeroVee  
Firewall Forward Kits which may contain the parts you need  
for the oil cooler installation as well as the fuel system. 

impoRTAnT: Because of the wide range of possible in- 
stallation variations, the hardware and fittings mentioned  
in this manual and included in the 3rd-party hardware kits  
may or may not match your specific needs or desires. Each  
builder must make their own determination of which parts  
are appropriate for their particular installation.

it will collect water from your fuel system for easy draining. 

Never use teflon tape on any fuel system connections as it may  
block fuel flow.

Exhaust Cut-outs 
The size of the exhaust outlet(s) is a critical for proper cooling.    
The Sonex requires  47 to 50 square inches of outlet area for  
the cooling air. 

The cowling provided with your kit is one of two types: a VW  
cowl with premolded exhaust tunnels (detailed below), or a  
Universal cowl, detailed on the next page. 

VW Cowl with Pre-molded Exhaust Tunnel 
The VW cowl with pre-molded exhaust tunnels was phased  
out in favor of the Universal cowl in 2004. The change was  
made to eliminate the cheeks on the side of the cowl. 

The VW cowl must have the exhaust outlets cut open to the                     Aluminum-lined  
proper size and have air deflector lips added, as shown in the                 Exhaust Tunnel 
accompanying photos. In addition, .025" aluminum sheet is  
riveted to the exhaust tunnel to protect the fiberglass from the  
hot exhaust gasses.

AeroVee 2.1 Rev AA. 08/05/2015                                             Part Numbers and Packing Lists 

Keep Your Packing Lists 
The packing list provided with each AeroVee kit lists the spe- 
cific parts provided for that specific engine. Please reference  
your engine's packing list for correct part numbers when or- 
dering maintenance and repair parts for your particular engine. 

In addition to the packing list secured to the outside of the  
engine kit boxes, a duplicate packing list has been attached to  
the back of each physical manual supplied with that engine. 

If you are holding a manual provided with an engine that was  
shipped after January 1st, 2014, there should be a copy of the  
original packing list attached after third page. If there is no  
packing list attached the manual you have may have printed  
from the website, provided as a replacement, or the packing  
list may have been removed.  

Copies of (most) packing lists are archived by Sonex Aircraft  
and you may request an electronic (PDF) copy. To get a copy,  
provide evidence you own the engine for which you are re- 
questing the original packing list as well as the engine's serial  
number. 

Part Number Changes - Interchangeable Parts 
AeroConversions reserves the right to supply compatible,  
alternative replacement parts for any part of the core engine or  
conversion package. Such parts may appear different than the  
part originally provided in the kit or depicted in the manual,  
and may bear a different part number, but will be functionally  
identical or superior to the original kit-supplied component.
