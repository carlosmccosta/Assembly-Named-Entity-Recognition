                       SAFETY PRECAUTIONS  
                                          
    General  safety  precautions  used  in  machine  shops  must  
be  used  in  the  machining  operations  necessary  for  the  
finishing of this kit.  
      
     USE PROTECTIVE EYE WEAR AT ALL TIMES.  
     USE    ADEQUATE         VENTILATION        WHEN      USING      CUTTING  
          FLUIDS.  
    AVOID  SKIN  CONTACT  WITH  CUTTING  FLUIDS  AND  OTHER  
          CHEMICALS.  
      
    Some of the chemicals and materials recommended for  
cleaning, part retention and cutting fluids may be toxic if not  
used  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  provided  by  the  
manufacturer of the materials.  Some of the recommended  
chemicals or materials may be flammable and should not be  
used around open flame or other possible sources of ignition.  
      
    This engine is designed to run at pressures up to 30 PSI.  At  
this pressure, the no load engine speed can be expected to  
be 5000 to 6000 RPM.  If the kit is machined, assembled and  
operated in accordance with these instructions, no problems  
should  be  experienced.    Pressures  greater  than  30  PSI  may  
cause mechanical failure in the engine.  If the engine is run  
on  steam,  the  steam  supply  boiler  MUST  have  a  safety  
release valve set to no higher than 35 PSI.  
      
                           LIMITED WARRANTY  
                                            
    Graham Industries warrants that the materials supplied in  
this kit are free from defects for a period of 60 days from the

                                                   INTRODUCTION  
                                                                 
     The GAGE SC1 is a compact double-acting steam engine of 1/2” bore with a 5/8” stroke.  A  
slide valve is used to control the steam.  The compact size is possible by using a “Scotch yoke”  
drive between the piston and crankshaft.  An eccentric driven yoke operates the valve.  Using  
yoke  drives  eliminates  the  length  of  the  connecting  rod  and  crosshead  commonly  used  in  
steam engines.  
       
     The “Scotch yoke” has greater frictional losses than a conventional crosshead-connecting  
rod arrangement, however, unless operating a heavy load, the difference is small.  This engine  
is  non-reversing  as  shown  in  the  plans.    If  you  want  to  make  this  engine  reversing,  there  is  
enough room between the crankshaft bearings for a slip eccentric.  
       
     Modern  production  techniques,  using  computer  controlled  machine  tools,  have  made  
practical  replacing  traditional  castings  with  parts  pre-machined  from  solid  materials.    In  
general, these parts are not completely finished, however, there iis always the fitting, filing and  
polishing necessary to make a showpiece model.  

                                                                                                         1

                                                            ASSEMBLY  
                                                                      
     Now it all comes together.  The rest of the parts in the kit are useable as they are supplied,  
but you may want to clean them up with a file and/or abrasive paper for appearance.  
       
     As  parts  are  assembled,  put  a  light  coat  of  oil  on  all  the  working  surfaces.    Use  a  good  
grade  of  light  sewing  machine  or  instrument  oil.    Some  household  oils  contain  more  solvent  
than oil and can not be recommended.  Automotive oil is too thick even in the lighter weights.   
I use Starrett Tool and Instrument oil.  It is available from many machinist supply companies.  
       
     Paper gaskets may be used if desired on all the sealing joints, but they are not necessary if  
the parts are well finished.  If you do use gaskets, use typing paper with oil applied to it.  
       
     Check the crankshaft assembly for any solder or retaining compound at the two joints and  
clean  if  necessary.    Make  sure  the  crankpin  and  crankshaft  do  not  protrude  beyond  the  
crankdisk where they are supposed to be flush.  File if necessary.  
       
     Remove any burrs from the 5/16” x 3/16” thrust washer and slide it on the crankshaft.  Check  
the crankshaft fit in the bearing holes in the base.  If the base was painted, there may be a little  
bit of paint in the bearings.  Remove the crankshaft assembly.  
       
     Slide the valve drive yoke into the 1/16” holes in the base.  This needs to be a free sliding fit.   
Again, check for paint.  Enlarge the holes a little if necessary or bend the guide pins a little bit if  
there is binding at the ends of the pins only.  
       
     Insert a 2-56 x 3/32” setscrew in the eccentric.  Insert the eccentric in the valve drive yoke  
with  the  setscrew  ends  towards  the  flywheel  end.    Slide  the  crankshaft  with  thrust  washer  
through the inside bearing, the eccentric and the outside bearing.  
       
     Install  a  4-40  x  3/32”  setscrew  in  the  flywheel  hub.    Slide  the  flywheel  on  the  crankshaft.   
Place a piece of paper or shim stock about .003”  to .008” thick between the flywheel and front  
bearing.  Apply pressure between the flywheel and the crankdisk and tighten the setscrew in  
the flywheel.  Remove the spacer.  Leave the eccentric loose on the shaft for now.  Rotate the  
flywheel gently.  There should be no binding.  
       
     Place one of the standards on the base with the groove facing inside.  Secure to the base  
with  two  2-56  x  1/4”  pan  head  screws.    Do  not  tighten.    Place  the  scotch  yoke  slide  on  the  
crank pin and place the scotch guide on the slide.  Engage the end of the guide in the slot in  
the standard with the 5-40 hole away from the base.  Place the other standard on the base  
while engaging the guide in the slot of the standard.  Secure the standard to the base with two  
2-56 x 1/4” pan head screws.  
       
     Cut  two  strips  of  thin  paper  3/16”  wide  and  slide  them  between  each  standard  and  the  
scotch  yoke  guide  in  the  slots.    Position the  crankshaft to  place  the  guide  nearest the  base.   
Press the two standards together with your fingers.  Apply the pressure over the guide locations.   
Tighten the four screws attaching the standards to the base.  Remove the spacer papers.  
       

                     4

     Rotate the crankshaft to move the guide away from the base.  Place the cylinder mount on  
the standards and secure with four 2-56 x 3/16” fillister head screws.  Try rotating the crankshaft.   
If  the  guide  binds,  loosen  the  screws  on  the  cylinder  mount  and  spread  the  top  of  the  
standards  apart  slightly.    Tighten  the  screws.    If  binding  still  occurs,  locate  the  problem  and  
correct  it  before  continuing.    Sometimes  the  standards  will  tilt  slightly  toward  each  other  
because of shrinkage in the base casting.  If this is the case, it may be necessary to remove the  
standards  one  at  a  time  and  file  a  VERY  SLIGHT  bevel  on  the  bottom  of  the  standard  to  
compensate.  This is normally not necessary.  
       
     Now that the bottom part of the engine is operating smoothly, remove the cylinder mount.  
       
     Install a 3/8” ID x 1/2” OD “O” ring on the piston.  Be sure to put a little bit of oil on the “O”  
ring.  Check that the piston rod “O” ring retainer is an easy fit on the piston rod.  If it is tight,  
enlarge the 1/8” hole with a needle file or a #31 drill bit.  Make sure there are no burrs.  Remove  
the “O” ring retainer.  
       
     Slide  the  piston  rod  through  the  cylinder  mount  from  the  side  of  the  mount  opposite  the  
recess for the piston rod seal.  Put some oil on the 1/8” ID x 1/4” OD “O” ring and slide it on the  
piston rod.  Be gentle sliding over the threaded portion of the piston rod so the “O” ring is not  
damaged.  Press the “O” ring retainer on the piston rod and secure to the cylinder mount with  
two 0-80 x 1/8” long screws.  Thread the 5-40 jam nut on the piston rod.  
       
     Decision time:  The steam inlet and exhaust should be on opposite sides of the cylinder (but  
this is not required).  The cylinder is completely symmetrical so the exhaust can be on either side  
of the engine.  If you have a preference as to which side of the engine the exhaust is on, place  
it on that side during the following step.  
       
     Oil the bore of the cylinder.  Slide the cylinder onto the piston and seat it on the cylinder  
mount.  Rotate the cylinder so the port face is to one side of the cylinder mount and secure the  
cylinder to the cylinder mount with six 2-56 x 3/16” fillister head screws.  
       
     Check  that  there  are  no  burrs  inside  the  steam  chest.    Insert  the  valve  rod  assembly  
threaded end through the hole in either end of the chest from the INSIDE of the chest.  Slide it  
all the way in.  The valve driver will barely fit past the opposite end of the chest.  Slide the rod  
back through the hole in the opposite end of  the chest.  
       
     Slide an oiled 1/16” ID “O” ring on each end of the valve rod.  Press them into the recess on  
each  end  of  the  valve chest.    Check  the  “O”  ring  retainers  for  an  easy  fit  on  the  valve  rod.   
Open them up with a #52 or #51 drill bit if necessary.  Remove any burrs.  Slide a retainer on  
each end of the rod and secure them to the steam chest with 0-80 x 1/8” fillister head machine  
screws.  Slide the rod to make sure there are no binds.  Thread the 0-80 nut on the end of the  
rod.  
       
     Lightly oil the port face of the cylinder.  Set the valve on the port face with the valve recess  
next to the cylinder.  Orient the steam chest so the steam inlet is on the opposite side of the  
cylinder steam exhaust and the long end of the valve rod extends beyond the cylinder mount.   
Place the steam chest cover over the port face with the valve driver engaging the valve in the  
wide  slot  and  the  valve  rod  passing  through  the  narrow  slot.    Temporarily  secure  the  steam  
chest to the cylinder with two 2-56 x 7/16” pan head machine screws.  These screws may not  
                                                                                                               5  
seat as the chest cover is not installed yet.  
       

----------------------- Page 14-----------------------

     Place the cylinder assembly on top of the standards and secure with four 2-56 x 3/16” pan  
head machine screws.  Adjust the standards as before to make sure the scotch yoke guide is  
free.    Tighten  the  mounting  screws.    Position  the  crankshaft  to  move  the  scotch  yoke  guide  
nearest the base.  
       
     Use  a  small  screwdriver  to  push  the  piston  down  to  engage  the  piston  rod  thread  in  the  
guide.  Turn the piston using the screwdriver in the slot in the piston rod to thread the rod into  
the guide.   Thread the rod into the guide until you  feel the piston touch the cylinder mount.   
Make sure the guide is at the bottom of the stroke nearest the base.  Rotate the piston in the  
opposite direction about 5/8 of a turn.  Rotate the crankshaft to place the piston at the top  
end of the cylinder.  There should be about 1/64” (.015”) between the piston top and the top of  
the cylinder.  Tighten the piston rod jam nut against the guide while keeping the piston from  
turning with the screwdriver.  
       
     This engine can’t be reversed in operation, but it can be adjusted to run in either direction  
by the setting of the eccentric.  Decide which direction you want the engine to run.  
       
     Rotate the crankshaft so the piston is at the top of the cylinder.  Rotate the eccentric so the  
setscrew faces the side of the engine that you want the top of the flywheel to rotate toward.   
Center the face of the eccentric in the valve drive yoke and tighten the setscrew.  Rotate the  
crankshaft so the eccentric setscrew is up.  Check that the position of the scotch yoke guide is  
in the middle of it’s travel.  
       
     With  the  eccentric  setscrew  facing  up,  press  the  valve  rod  down  to  engage  the  0-80  
threads.  Thread the valve rod into the valve drive yoke.  If a small drill chuck is available, use it  
to  grip  the  portion  of  the  valve  rod  that  protrudes  above  the  steam  chest.    Otherwise,  use  
smooth jaw needle nose pliers to turn the rod.  
       
     After  the  rod  is  started  in  the  yoke,  remove  the  drill  chuck  (if  used)  and  rotate  the  
crankshaft.    Adjust  the  valve  rod  so  the  steam  ports  I  the  cylinder  are  uncovered  an  equal  
amount at the ends of the valve travel.  Tighten the 0-80 nut on the valve rod against the yoke.   
Check the setting of the valve once again.  
       
     Remove the two screws holding the steam chest in place.  Using these two screws and two  
more, install the steam chest cover on the steam chest.  Align the chest cover and the chest to  
the cylinder edges and tighten the screws.  
       
     Rotate the crankshaft several times to check for binding.  Install the cylinder cover on the  
cylinder on the cylinder using six 2-56 x 3/16” fillister head screws.  Check for any binding again.  
       
     Attach the steam fittings with pipes to the cylinder and steam chest with 0-80 x 1/8” fillister  
head screws.  The 1/8” pipe is the steam inlet and attaches to the steam chest.  The 5/32” pipe  
is the exhaust pipe and attaches to the cylinder block.

                                                       TEST RUNNING  
                                                                    
     For  test  funning  the  engine,  a  supply  of  regulated  air  adjustable  from  0  to  30  PSI  is  
recommended.  
       
     Clamp the base of the engine in a drill press vise.  If the base is painted, use strips of paper  
to prevent chipping the paint.  Oil all the bearings, the sides of the scotch yoke guide, the slider  
and the eccentric.  Place a few drops of oil in the steam inlet pipe.  
       
     Connect the air supply to the steam inlet pipe.  If no additional fittings have been installed  
on  the  steam  inlet,  slide  a  piece  of  1/8”  ID  plastic  tubing  over  the  inlet  pipe  to  make  the  
connection.  
       
     Set  the  air  pressure  to  10  PSI  and  rotate  the  flywheel  in  the  direction  you  have  selected  
during the eccentric adjustment.  The engine should start running.  If it tries, but does not keep  
running,  increase  the  pressure  to  a  maximum  of  20  PSI.    If  the  engine  will  not  run  at  20  PSI,  
something is binding or out of adjustment.  If no binding is present, check the eccentric setting.   
It must be at 90 degrees to the crankshaft.  
       
     After the engine starts, let it run for a few minutes.  Then reduce the pressure intil it stops.  This  
will probably be about 7 or 8 PSI.  Increase the pressure a few pounds and restart the engine.   
Let the engine run for an hour or two at this speed.  About every 20 minutes, disconnect the air  
and add a few drops of oil in the steam inlet.  This extra oil is necessary to carry away metal  
particles from the face of the valve as it wears in.  You will probably notice that the oil coming  
from the exhaust will be darkened from these particles.  
       
     After the engine has run in at low speeds, the speed can be increased by increasing the air  
pressure.  DO NOT EXCEED 30 PSI.  As the engine continues to run in, the low speed operation  
will improve.  The prototypes all ran on about 3 PSI after they had several hours of running time

                                                   STEAM OPERATION  
                                                                    
     Operation  on  steam  requires  some  form  of  lubrication  system  for  the  steam.    Unlike  air  
operation, the wet steam washes away the oil on the valve and in the cylinder.  
       
     A displacement lubricator attached to the engine at the inlet pipe is the easiest, but other  
types can be used.  
       
     While steam cylinder oil is the best, other types can be used if the engine is not being used  
with steam pressures higher than 25 PSI and the steam is not superheated.
