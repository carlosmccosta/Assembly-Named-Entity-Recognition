Note: The flywheel may require some effort to get it started and seated on the drive pins. This is normal.
3. Install wavy washer and gland nut with Locktite 272. Torque to 227 ft-lbs.
Note: A piece of wood temporarily bolted to the prop hub provides good leverage to keep the crank from turning while the gland nut is being torqued.




ACCESSORY PLATE INSTALLATION

1. Bend P-Lead tabs on ignition modules 900
to clear the accessory
plate.
2. Attach ignition modules to the accessory plate using ACVZ01-13 Cap Screws and ACV-Z01-30 hex nuts. Install bolt at the bottom of the slot. The note ‘ThiS Side oUT” stamped in each magnatron must face towards the front of the engine.

Note: The Ignition Timing is fixed. There is no need to time the primary ignition system.




TRIGGER SHAFT INSTALLATION

Trigger Shaft Installation
1. 	Rotate the crank until the magnet shoe (A) on the flywheel is at the top of the engine. This will also put the witness hole in the flywheel assembly (B) near the 12 o'clock position, as shown in the photo below.
2. Line up the witness hole in the trigger shaft (C) with the witness hole in the flywheel. Apply Locktite 242 to each of the four (4) ACV-Z01-81 flat head cap screws and install them loosely. They will be tightened in step 3.
Note: If your trigger shaft does not have a witness hole, the trigger shaft may be attached in any orientation.
3. Sequentially tighten the screws in the crossing pattern shown below. This will center the shaft on the flywheel.




SPARK PLUG INSTALLATION

Plug Installation:
1. Gap four (4) TOP spark plugs to 0.018".
2. Gap four (4) BOTTOM spark plugs to 0.032".

4. Torque each spark plug to 12 foot-pounds.




INTAKE MANIFOLD INSTALLATION

Assembly Instructions
1. 	Temporarily place each of the intake elbow spacers and intake elbows on the cylinder heads and inspect for interference between the elbows and the two upper, center head studs. If necessary, trim the ends of the studs to eliminate interference.
2. 	Apply Permatex Aviation Form-A-Gasket #3 to one side of each in take elbow spacer and position each spacer on each cylinder head, Permatex side against the cylinder head.
3. 	Apply Permatex Aviation Form-A-Gasket #3 to each intake elbow and secure the elbows to the cylinder heads with ACV-Z01-26 Washers (Qty 4), and ACV-Z01-49 Cap Screws (Qty. 4) torqued to 10 foot pounds.
4. Thoroughly clean the inside of the manifold before installing it.
5. 	Secure an intake hose to each intake elbow with a hose clamp from the intake boot kit.
6. 	Push the intake manifold securely inside the hose and secure it with hose clamps from the intake boot kit.
7. 	Secure the intake manifold to the engine with the lower, aft engine case bolt. Bend the mounting tab on the intake manifold as needed to clear the lower Magnatron.
8. 	Attach the AeroInjector to the bottom of the manifold using the remaining hose and hose clamps from the intake boot kit. Note: For uniform delivery of the fuel mixture, the AeroInjector must be installed parallel to the airframe.
Note: Fuel inlet goes to the back of the engine.
9. 	Safety wire the AeroInjector to the intake manifold.
10. Throttle, mixture, fuel line and air filter connections are described in the AeroInjector manual.




ALTERNATOR INSTALLATION

Stator Assembly
1. Test fit the stator to the stator plate. If interference is noted between the mounting lugs of the stator and the boss on the plate, sand or file the lugs to remove the interference.
2. 	Pass the wires of the stator through the hole in the stator plate.
3. Prime four ACVZ01-76 screws with Locktite 7088 Primer.
4. Attach the stator to the alternator mount plate using the four (4) primed ACV-Z01-76 screws and Locktite 242 on each screw prior.


Installing the Stator Assembly
1. 	"Paint" the surface of each magnet in the magnet ring and the outside of the stator with a permanent marker.
Important: The magnets of the magnet ring are very strong and will try to pull the stator assembly out of your hands as you install it. Maintain a firm grip to avoid pinched fingers.
2. Carefully place the stator assembly over the magnet ring with the "top" pick-up near the 1 O'clock position and the "bottom" pick-up near the 7 O'clock position. The magnet ring may force the stator assembly into an unwanted position. Rotate the flywheel until the stator plate can be properly positioned.
3. Temporarily install 6 (six) ACV-Z01-12 cap screws to secure the stator assembly in place.
4. Rotate the crank shaft 3 or 4 full revolutions. This is easily done by removing a spark plug and turning the crank with a socket wrench on the prop hub bolt.
5. Remove the stator plate and inspect the magnet ring and stator for signs that the two are in contact with each other. If the marker is intact on both parts, your clearance is acceptable. Continue with Step 6. If there is evidence of contact between the parts, use a belt sander or equivalent to remove some material from the stator where the marker has been rubbed away and then repeat steps 1 through 5.
6. Re-install the stator assembly as described in Step 2.
7. Prime six ACV-Z01-12 screws with Locktite 7088 Primer.
8. Secure the stator assembly to the accessory plate using six primed ACV-Z01-12 screws and Locktite 242.
