93064 (BASED ON 7072 MC) 93115 (BASED ON 7260 MA) 94064 (BASED ON 7072 MD) 94115 (BASED ON 7260 MD) 



These maintenance instructions cover 24 volt ordnance cranking motors including the MA, MB, and MC styles which are adjustable timing motors, and MD and ME style motors which are fixed timing motors. 
NOTE: The difference between the MD/ME style motor and the MA/MB/MC style motor is the way the switch plunger is con­nected to the shift lever. On MD and ME style (fixed timing) motors, the switch plunger has a link spool that hooks to the shift lever. On MA, MB and MC style (adjustable timing) motors, the switch plunger is screwed on a link that is attached to the shift lever. 
ME motors have a simplified commutator end (C.E.) housing and brush rigging assembly design, which eliminates many parts, making servicing easier, especially brush changing, and achieving the same level of sealing as factory built units after field service. 

MODE OF OPERATION 
[See figure 1] 
When the start switch is closed, the coils  in the solenoid are energized, creating a magnetic field. The field pulls the plunger inward, which causes the shift lever to push the drive assembly into mesh with the ring gear on the engine flywheel. Once the pinion is in mesh, the plunger pushes the contacts closed, and closes the circuit between the battery and the motor. 
The current passes through the field coil then through the brush­es to the armature commutator. The current forms interacting magnetic fields around the field coil pole pieces and the arma­ture lamination pack, and causes the armature to turn. The arma­ture turns the drive pinion, which turns the ring gear, cranking the engine. 
When the engine starts, the start switch is released. This causes the magnetic field in the solenoid to collapse, and a return spring forces the plunger outwards. This opens the contacts, and then disengages the drive assembly from the ring gear. 





CRANKING MOTOR TROUBLESHOOTING 
1. 	
Check specific gravity of batteries. Minimum allowed is 1.230SP GR (75% charged). NOTE. A digital voltmeter can be used to establish the state of battery charge. Before any voltage measurements are taken, the engine must be turned off and battery surface charge be removed by turn­ing on the headlights or similar load for 5-10 minutes. IF voltage shows a rapid increase in voltage to about 12.45V or higher on turning off the load, then the surface charge has not been fully removed, repeat operation. When volt­age rises slowly to 12.45V or higher, the surface charge has been fully removed, and the state of battery charge is at least 75%. 

2. 	
Connect a jumper from switch terminal #2 to #1 for 2-3 seconds. (Jumper must be at least 12 gage, and have insu­lated clips. ENSURE THAT THE VEHICLE TRANSMISSION IS NOT IN GEAR, AND THE PARKING BRAKE IS APPLIED IF THIS IS PERFORMED ON A VEHICLE ENGINE. 


If the switch activates and the motor spins and the motor cranks the engine, then motor and switch are OK. Check wiring, terminals, start and/or ignition switches and start relay if used. 
If the switch activates and the motor spins, but then engine does not crank, then the drive assembly or shift mechanism is faulty, and the starter should be removed for further diag­nosis. 
If the switch activates but the motor does not spin, the prob­lem may be the switch contacts, or the motor. Check with a voltmeter the voltage at the #3 terminal. If battery voltage is found, the motor has a break in the circuit within the case, if there is less than 1V at the terminal, then the switch con­tacts are not closing. In either case, it is best to remove the cranking motor for further diagnosis. 
If the switch does not activate, see step 3 
3. 	With the jumper connected from terminals #2 to #1, ground terminal #4 using a jumper between #4 terminal and the ground terminal on the back of the motor. If the switch activates and the motor cranks, the ground jumper wire is defective and must be replaced. If the switch does not activate, then switch is defective and must be removed for service or replacement. 

DISASSEMBLY AND TESTING 
Note: Disconnect battery ground cable. 
1. 	
Remove cranking motor from engine. 

2. 	
Remove switch from field ring as follows: 


2.1 Remove ground lead from terminal #4 
2.2 Remove nut from terminal #3. Apply no more than 35 lbf-ft. If the nut will not come loose due to presence of locking compound, heat the nut with a small blowtorch. 
2.3 Remove nut and jumper strap from motor and field stud. 

2.4 Remove the two hex head screws retaining the switch brack­et to the field ring. 
2.5 On MD, ME models, pull the switch away from the shift housing, and rotate the body so that the switch brackets are away from the motor. Lift the switch up and pull it away from the shift housing. 
ON MA and MB motors, pull the switch away from the shift housing, and hold the plunger with a strap wrench, or wrap a strip of emery cloth around the plunger to avoid nicks, and grip with a pair of channel lock pliers, and unscrew the spool from the plunger for a few turns. Remove the rubber plug from the base of the solenoid, between terminals #1 and #3, and using a 1/4” deep well socket, unscrew the plunger to separate the switch from the shift housing. 
Caution: If the plunger surface is nicked, the high points must be cleaned up to prevent damage to the bushing in the solenoid, or the plunger replaced. 


3. 	Switch disassembly performed as follows: 
3.1 Remove nuts, lockwashers, spacers and o-rings from the #1 and #4 terminals. 
3.2 Pull plastic end base out just enough the expose the inter­nal connection to the #3 terminal, and remove the screw to disconnect the lead. Then remove the base from the sole­noid. 
On fixed timing motors, inspect the boot for tears or seals. If in good condition, re-use the boot, otherwise grip the plunger as in 2.5 and unscrew the spool to replace the boot, as in figure 4. 

3.3 Holding the plunger, either by gripping in a vise, or as in 2.5, heat the 1/4” nut on the contact disc shaft with a small flame propane torch to soften the locking compound. 
3.4 Unscrew the nut a few turns. Either hold down the contact disc against the spring pressure, or place the base back on the switch before completing removal of the nut to prevent the disc and other components from flying off. 
3.5 Inspect all insulation washers and bushing. Broken, cracked or burned insulators must be replaced with new ones. 
3.6 Inspect conical spring. If it is collapsed, or shows signs of heat, then replace with new. 
Switch Coil Ground Test 
Connect one ohmmeter lead to terminal #1, and the sec­ond test lead to a bare metal surface on the housing. (fig­ure 5) 
LOW resistance (<10kiloohms) - coil is grounded: switch assembly must be replaced. 
HIGH resistance (>10kiloohms) - Coil is OK: continue with step 5 

MA, MB, MC motor CE housing 
1. 	
Remove two #10 screws and brush opening band assembly. 

2. 	
Remove screws from the brush leads and lock plates. 

3. 	
Pull springs upward with tool shown in fig. 7, and remove the brushes. 

4. 	
Inspect brushes for wear. Brushes less than 5/8” in length must be replaced. 

5. 	
Mark CE housing in relation to field ring with a punch or paint marker. 

6. 	
Remove four hex head screws and remove CE housing. 

7. 	
Remove ground jumper if fitted to the field coil side of the brushholders. If the insulation is burned or damaged, the jumper must be replaced. 




8. 	
Insert a new brush in each brush slot (with the spring held out of the way). If the brush does not move freely on one of the slots, then that brushholder must be replaced. 

9. 	
Inspect each of the four brushholders. Discoloration, burns or distortion indicate defective or improperly assembled insulators 

10. 
Brush Holder Insulation Test 

Connect an ohmmeter test lead to each of two adjacent brushholders. (figure 8) A LOW resistance reading indi­cates that an insulation bushing or washer is defective and must be replaced. 

11. 
Brush Holder Assembly Ground Test 



On later CE assemblies which have the ground strap con­necting the two negative brush holders positioned between the brushholder and CE housing casting, position the strap to ensure that it is not touching the casting at any point (it is easiest to loosely replace the brush screws to hold it in position). Connect one ohmmeter test lead to a bare metal surface on the CE housing, and the second test lead it turn to each of the four brush holders. LOW resistance indicates a grounded brush holder caused by defective insulator(s). (figure 9). On later CE assemblies this could also be caused by the ground stud insulators - separate the ground stud jumper from the brushholder, and re-test to determine which is responsible for the short. 

12. 
Visually inspect insulators at each of the four mounting posts. Broken, cracked, burned or charred insulators must be replaced. 

13. 
Ground Stud insulation test. 

Ensure that the ground stud jumper is not touching the brush-holder. Connect one ohmmeter test lead to a bare metal surface on the CE housing, and the second test lead to the ground stud. LOW resistance indicates a defective insula­tion bushing or washer. 

14. 
Inspect bronze bushing in CE housing. If inside diameter is greater than 0.756”, or there is evidence of heat, or rota­tion of the bushing in the housing (look for misalignment between the crossdrilling and the oilwick hole), then bush­ing must be replaced (see Assembly section for specific instructions). 



ME model CE Housing and Brush Plate Disassembly and Testing 
1. 	
Remove hardware and insulators from ground stud. 

2. 	
Remove 6 screws and sealing rings from CE housing, and remove housing (tap underside of housing with soft-faced mallet to ease housing off o-ring seal). Remove and inspect bushing and inner insulator for damage. 

3. 	
Check CE housing for damage including scoring or corro­sion of the sealing surface, distortion or cracking of the casting. If inside diameter is greater than 0.756”, or there is evidence of heat, or rotation of the bushing in the hous­ing (look for misalignment between the crossdrilling and the oilwick hole), then bushing must be replaced (see Assembly section for specific instructions). 



4. 	
Remove the four screws holding the field coil connecting tabs to the brushholders, and lift the brush plate off the motor. 

5. 	
Remove the four screws holding the ground stud and jumper assembly to the brushholders, and remove it and the brushes from the brush plate assembly. Brushes less than 5/8” in length must be replaced. Ensure that the brush flex­ible leads are not melted or have broken strands. 

6. 	
Visually inspect brush plate. Ensure that the rivets are hold­ing the brushholders securely to the plate, and that the plate is not cracked, charred, or has material broken away from the clamping areas around the periphery. See figure 10 




Motor Disassembly and Testing Continued 
Note: Mark nose housing and shift housing with a punch or paint marker to aid proper positioning at reassembly. 
1. 	
Remove the six socket head screws from the nose (pinion) housing. Tap the flange to ease the nose out of the shift housing. 

2. 	
Inspect the nose housing bushing. If inside diameter is greater than .753” , or there is evidence of heat, or rota­tion of the bushing in the housing (look for misalignment between the crossdrilling and the oilwick hole), then bush­ing, or assembly must be replaced. 

3. 	
Pull armature out of motor, and remove drive assembly and brake washer. 

4. 	
Inspect drive. 

If drive pinion rotates in both directions or does not push smoothly into the assembly, then a new drive must be installed. 

5. 	
Remove the five socket head screws, and remove shift housing. 

6. 	
Inspect shift housing bushing and seal. Replace bushing if diameter is larger than 0.878”. 


7. 	
On MA and MB motors, remove rubber boot from shift housing, and inspect for damage. IF found in good condi­tion, reuse boot. 

8. 	
Unscrew the #10 screw and remove the flat washer, then remove shaft (pry out using screwdriver in slot for washer). If shift lever shaft surface has grooves worn by the shift lever, or is corroded, replace. Inspect o-ring for damage. 

9. 	
Remove the shift lever from the housing and inspect the shift lever pivot hole for elongation. If worn oval (over .508”) shift housing must be replaced. On MA, MB and MC motors, remove the roll pin from the arm and link assembly, check the aperture on the link screw for wear, and replace the roll pin with a new part. 

10. 
Check the armature shaft splines for twist, wear or corro­sion. If damaged, the armature must be replaced. 

11.
 Armature ground Test 

Connect one ohmmeter test lead to the armature shaft, and the second test lead to the commutator. LOW resistance indicates a ground, and the armature must be replaced. 

12. 
Perform armature growler test to ensure armature is not shorted. 

13. 
Check commutator surface. If commutator is pitted, rough scored, burned, or coated with hard carbon or oil, the commutator must be turned. Minimum diameter is 2.06” and concentricity between the commutator surface and the bearing diameters that fit in the CE and shift housings, should be 0.003” or better. 

14. 
Field Coil Ground Test 


Connect one ohmmeter test lead to a bare metal surface on the field ring, and the second to either of the two field coil/brush jumpers. LOW resistance indicates a ground, and the field coil must be replaced. 
Note: It is recommended that a hi-pot test be performed, on the intact field coil and frame assembly by a qualified elec­trical shop. THIS TEST CAN CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH. ONLY TO BE PERFORMED BY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL! 
15. Inspect the interior of he field ring and field coil. If burn marks are noticed on the field coil insulation, the field coil must be replaced. If there are rub marks on the pole pieces and armature stack, check the condition of the CE housing and shift housing bushings, and replace as necessary. 


COMPONENT CLEANING 
1. Solenoid switch, armature field coil, ME brush plate and drive assembly should not be immersed in solvents, and can be cleaned using a cloth with a little solvent on it. Remove brush dust from armature and field ring assembly using compressed air. 

2. 	
Clean all other metal parts with cleaning solvent, and a wire brush where appropriate. 

3. 	
MA/MB/MC style brushholder assemblies, insulation washers, bushing and spacers can be cleaned by dipping in solvent and drying off using compressed air. 


Note: Brushholder insulators can usually be cleaned with­out removal.

MA, MB MC and MD Motor CE housing Assembly: 
1. 	Assemble CE housing as follows ­
1.1 If suitable machining facilities are available, it is possible to replace an oversize bushing in the CE housing. Press a new bushing into the housing after pulling the old bushing out using an expanding bearing puller. Cross drill the bush­ing through the existing hole using a 11/32” drill then ream bushing to 0.754”, checking that there are no remaining burrs from the drilling. However, given the diffi­culty of ensuring that concentricity is maintained, a replace­ment CE housing is recommended if facilities are limited. 
1.2 Slide guard washer and insulating washer on the ground stud and insert it in the terminal bore in the CE housing. Align the ground stud in its correct position (if needed, assemble a brushholder temporarily in place to indicate the correct location for the jumper on the ground stud) and complete installation as shown in figure 13. Tighten to 18­22 lbf-ft. Hold square head of bolt with a wrench to pre­vent rotation. 
1.3 Install brushholders on CE housing as follows:

13.3 Match the alignment markings made at disassembly and secure nose housing the shift housing with 6 socket head screws with 1-2 drops of Loctite 242 applied to the threads. Torque to 13-17 lbf-ft. 
NOTE: The shift housings used on these motors have 12 tapped holes to allow the nose to be “indexed” (posi­tioned) in a variety of positions. Only 6 screws are used to mount the nose, and when the top hole is not used, then a socket head setscrew is used, with 1-2 drops of Loctite 242 applied to the threads, to seal the top hole. On ME motors, a button head screw with an o-ring is used. See figure 25. 
13.4 	
Install rubber plugs on the six holes in the nose housing not used. 

14. 	
MA, MB, MC models, motor brush installation performed as follows: 


14.1 Pass two 8-32 screws through a lockplate, and slide a brush terminal onto each of the screws. Fasten the assem­bly to the brushholder, with the flexibles positioned away from brushholder tunnel. 
14.2 Using the hook tool shown in figure 26, pull the inside brushholder spring up and insert the brush on the slot, ensuring that the flexibles are not twisted or trapped (see installed brush in figure 26). Repeat this step for the outer brush. 



14.3 Wrap the brush opening band around the four brush openings in the position of the paint line, and secure with two #10-32 screws. 
Before installing the band, ensure that dirt, oil or any 
other foreign matter is removed from around the brush 
openings to ensure proper sealing. 
15. Assemble the switch as follows: 
15.1 Slide the return spring on the plunger shaft, and insert the shaft through the yoke and through the hole in the sta­tionary core so that the shaft sticks out into the contact cavity. 
NOTE: Ensure that the plunger is free from any nicks, burrs or corrosion. If not, then a new plunger must be 
used. 
15.2 Place the switch with the plunger pointing down (open end of the switch body facing up) in a vise so the plunger rests on the vise slide bar (the part that joins the two jaws together). Press the switch housing down to force the plunger all the way into the switch body against the return spring. With both legs of the switch bracket facing one of the two jaws, clamp the switch housing in the vise with just enough pressure to hold the switch in place, to avoid bending the bracket. 
15.3 Slide the 1/4” ID steel washer onto the shaft so it fits flush with the shoulder. 
15.4 Slide the 1/4” ID insulation washer onto the shaft and place it against the steel washer. 
15.5 Slide the 1/4” ID bushing on the shaft, and place against the insulation washer. 
15.6 Place the small end of the conical spring against the insu­lation washer. 
15.7 Place the 2” OD copper contact disc on the conical spring, and depress the spring so the disc passes down over the insulation bushing. 
15.8 While depressing the contact disc, place the 3/8” ID insulation washer on the disc so the insulation bushing passes through the washer. 
15.9 Place the 1/8” ID steel washer on the shoulder of the shaft. 
15.10 Apply a drop of Loctite 242 to the shaft threads, and install the 1/4” locknut finger-tight to hold the contact disc. Grip the plunger in a soft jawed vise, and torque the nut to 55-60 lbf-in. See figure 27 for correct assem­bly. Holding the contact disc and insulator down over the bushing while tightening will ensure that the bushing is not damaged by compressing the washer against the end of it. 

15.11 Install the #2 and #3 contact studs in the contact base. Insert the 2-1/4” long stud in the #2 terminal hole, and slide two o-rings, a flat washer and a lockwasher onto the contact stud. Apply a drop of Loctite 242 to the stud threads, and tighten the jam nut to 23-27 lbf-in. Install the shorter terminal stud on the #3 hole in the same manner, ensuring that the tapped hole in the side of the head faces outward. 
15.12 Place the sealing ring over the outside of the switch hous­ing. 
15.13 Pass the two terminals through the #1 and #4 terminal holes in the plastic end base and connect the loose ter­minal to the #3 contact stud with a #6 screw. See figure 
28. 
15.14 Press the plastic contact base on the switch housing and slide two o-rings, a spacer bushing , a flat washer and a lockwasher (if nut/lockwasher assemblies are not used) onto the terminals. Secure with #10-32 nuts and tighten to 28-34 lbf-in. 
15.15 On MD and ME motors, slide the closed end of the rub­ber boot against the hex shoulder of the link spool. Install the link spool in the switch plunger and torque to 54-66 lbf-in. Grip the plunger either in soft jaws in a vise or using a pipe wrench and a strip of emery cloth to grip the plunger. Ensure that no nicks or burrs are raised dur­ing this operation. Figure 29 







SWITCH INSTALLATION AND TIMING 
FOR MA MB AND MC STYLE MOTORS 

NOTE: Read these instructions through before starting this operation. Once started, the timing procedure must be completed within 15 minutes to avoid the locking com­pound from setting before the switch is in place and cor­rectly adjusted. 
1. 	
Apply a bead of Loctite 2114 to the first 1/2” of the link screw threads. NOTE Link screw must be free of dirt, oil or grease. See figure 30. 

2. 	
Apply a thin film of SAE 10-30 grade oil or NLGI OO grade grease around the ‘nose’ of the switch yoke that will fit inside the shift housing. 


3.
 Insert a 1/4” deep well socket in the access hole in the plas­tic end base, and engage with the 1/4” locknut. 

4.
 Position the switch (with two mounting legs away from the field ring) in alignment with the link screw, and screw the plunger by turning the socket five complete turns. 

5.
 Turn the switch so the mounting legs rest on the field ring and continue turning the socket an additional 10 turns. 

6.
 Press the switch assembly flush with the shift housing. 

7.
 Apply 1-2 drops of Loctite 242 to the threads of the two 3/8­24 x .38” hex head screws, and secure the switch to the field ring. Torque to 20-24 lbf-ft. 

8.
 Place the jumper strap over the #3 terminal and the field stud, and torque the jam nut on the #3 terminal to 21-29 lbf-ft and the one on the field stud to 18-22 lbf-ft. CAUTION: Use an open wrench to support the bottom nut while tight­ening the nut holding the jumper to the field coil stud. See Figure 31. 

9.1 
Connect 24 volts from a battery through a switch to termi­nals #1 and #4. (switch initially on off position). 




9.2 Turn the switch on, and measure the gap between the pin­ion face ant the thrust washer. Proper gap is .187” (3/16”). See figure 32. To perform these procedures the cranking motor in not wired as on a vehicle, and in most cases the solenoid will not have sufficient strength to pull the drive forward to the “engagement” position. In such a case, pry the pinion with a screwdriver until the solenoid takes over. Alternatively, “flash” the switch closed by momentarily touching the #4 terminal with the ground lead or other jumper lead connected to the motor negative ter­minal (assuming that the motor is now complete and pro­vides a circuit for the pull-in current through the motor wind-ings).CAUTION: Switch must not be energized for more than 30 seconds at a time. 

9.3 If the gap is greater or smaller than 3/16”, then turn off battery power. Insert the 1/4” socket in the access hole and turn the nut CLOCKWISE to decrease the gap, or COUNTERCLOCKWISE to increase the gap. CAUTION: Switch must not be energized while adjustments are being made. 
9.4 Install rubber plug in switch access hole. 
10. Install 	ground lead to switch terminal #4 with lockwasher and nut, or captive washer and nut assembly, torque nut to 28­32 lbf-in. 


SWITCH INSTALLATION ON “MD” AND “ME” STYLE MOTORS 
1. 	
Pull the drive fully forward, and, while holding it there, posi­tion the switch with two mounting legs away from the field ring, and hook the link spool over the top of the shift lever. CAUTION: taker care not to apply any pressure between the solenoid boot and the edge of the shift housing aper­ture, or the boot may be damaged. 

2. 	
Turn the switch so the mounting legs rest on the field ring, and press the switch assembly flush with the shift housing. 

3. 	
Apply 1-2 drops of Loctite 242 to the threads of the two 3/8-24 x .38” hex head screws, and secure the switch to the field ring. Torque to 22-27 lbf-ft. 

4. 	
Place the jumper strap over the #3 terminal and the field stud, and torque the jam nut on the #3 terminal to 21-29 lbf-ft and the one on the field stud to 18-22 lbf-ft. CAU­TION: Use an open wrench to support the bottom nut while tightening the nut holding the jumper to the field coil stud. 

5. 	
Install ground lead to switch terminal #4 with lockwasher and nut, or captive washer and nut assembly, torque nut to 28-32 lbf-in. 

6. 	
Install rubber plug in switch access hole. 




WIRING INSTALLATION 
1. 	
Install battery cable to #2 terminal. Torque nut to 30 lbf-ft. 

2. 	
Install start switch lead to #1 terminal. Torque nut to 30 lbf-in. 

3. 	
Install ground cable to motor ground stud. Torque nut to 30 lbf-ft. 


CAUTION: Use an open wrench to support the bottom nut while tightening the nut holding the ground lead. If this is not done, internal component failure may result.
