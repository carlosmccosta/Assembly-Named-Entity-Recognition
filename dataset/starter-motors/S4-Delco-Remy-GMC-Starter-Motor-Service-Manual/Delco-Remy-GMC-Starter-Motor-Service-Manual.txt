CORROSION PREVENTION AND CONTROL 
Corrosion Prevention and Control (CPC) or Army materiel is a continuing concern It is important that any corro­sion problem with the starter be reported so that improvements can be made to prevent the problem in the future. While corrosion is typically associated with rusting of metals, it can also include deterioration of other materials such as rubber and plastic. Unusual cracking, softening, swelling, or breaking of these materials may be a corro­sion problem. If a corrosion problem is identified, it can be reported using SF 368, (Product Quality Deficiency Report). Use of keywords such as “corrosion”, “rust”, deterioration”, or “cracking” will ensure that the information is identified as a CPC problem. SF 368 should be submitted to the address specified in DA PAM 750-

DESTRUCTION OF ARMY MATERIEL TO PREVENT ENEMY USE 
Refer to TM 750-
244-
6 for procedures on how to destroy the starter. 
Below are some general guidelines to follow in destruction of equipment to prevent enemy use. 
Destruction of equipment, when subject to capture or abandonment in a combat zone, will be undertaken only when such action is necessary in accordance with orders of, or policy established by the Army commander. 
In general, destruction of essential parts, followed by burning, will usually be sufficient to render equipment use­less. Time is usually critical. 
Material must be damaged so that it cannot be restored to usable condition by either repair or cannibalization. If lack of time or personnel prevents destruction of all parts, give priority to destruction of parts hardest to replace. It is important that the same parts be destroyed on all starters to prevent construction of one complete starter from several damaged ones. 
PREPARATION FOR STORAGE AND SHIPMENT 
Refer to TM 9-
2350-
256-
20 for instructions on preparation for storage and shipment. 
QUALITY OF MATERIAL 
Material used for replacement, repair, or modification must meet the requirements of this manual. If quality of ma­terial requirements are not stated in this manual, the material must meet the requirements of the drawings, stan­dards, specifications, or approved engineering change proposals applicable to the subject equipment.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF STARTER 
The Electrical Engine Starter is a heavy-
duty, 24-
volt DC cranking motor for large diesel engines. It is insulated and waterproof, and is resistant to both fungus and corrosion. Its output drive pinion is moved into mesh with an engine starter drive gear by a solenoid operated, enclosed shift lever. The starter motor output torque is applied to the drive pinion through a heavy-
duty overrunning clutch which prevents an engine from back-
driving motor armature. Pinion end clearance is adjustable.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STARTER 
NOTE 
Reference numbers shown in parentheses refer to the sectional view of the starter (fig. 
1-
--2). 
a.  Major Components. The major components of the starter are the frame assembly (23), armature (22), commutator end plate assembly (25), brush holder assembly (28), brushes (3), drive clutch assembly (19), drive housing (16), solenoid relay assembly (8), lever housing (13), shift lever (15), and solenoid plunger (10).  
b.  Frame Assembly. The frame assembly consists of field windings (5), pole shoes (6), and field winding terminal stud (4) mounted in and supported by the heavy steel cylindrical frame.  
1)  Field windings (5) are held in position on inside wall of the frame by the pole shoes (6). Each pole shoe is secured in place by two screws (21). Field windings are electrically interconnected in an arrangement of three pairs.  
2)  Each pair of field windings (5) are series connected, but reverse winding makes opposite polarity. All three pairs have a common connection at the field winding terminal stud (4). The field winding terminal stud is insulated from the frame in which it is mounted.  
c.  Armature. The armature (22) is made of copper and laminated steel assembled on a steel shaft. When installed, the armature is supported by three sleeve bearings (17, 20, and 27) and is free to rotate in the frame assembly.  
1)  A straight spline on drive end of armature shaft engages the internal spline of drive clutch-
assembly (19) so that it must rotate with the shaft but allows movement of the drive clutch assembly along the shaft.  
2)  Movement of drive clutch assembly (19) along the shaft provides the means of engaging and disengaging starter drive pinion (18) from the teeth on an engine’s starter drive gear.  
3)  A commutator, at end opposite drive end of the armature, provides selective electrical contact through brushes (3) as the armature rotates. This selective contact allows electrical current to flow through each armature winding in alternating directions as the armature rotates. As the current direction through a winding changes, magnetic polarity of the associated armature pole is reversed. These changes in polarity always force, in a pull and then push fashion, rotation of an armature pole past each pole shoe in one constant direction.  
d.  Commutator End Plate Assembly. The end plate of commutator end plate assembly (25) provides closure for that end of the starter frame and holds sleeve bearing (27) which supports the commutator end of armature (22). Brush holder assembly (28) has six brush holders and is mounted on the inner surface of the end plate but is electrically insulated from the end plate as necessary.  
e.  Brushes and Brush Holder Assemblies. Each brush is free to move in its brush holder only in a radial direction with respect to the circumference of the commutator. A helical torsion spring (26) is used (two in 12-
brush starter) at each brush holder to keep a positive contact pressure between brush and commutator. These springs and brush freedom in its holder accommodate change in brush length due to wear.  
1)  Alternate brush holders around commutator are electrically connected to provide one set of three brushes (three pairs of brushes in p/n 1109972) in common circuit. This set is connected to brush holder terminal stud (1).

2) 	Brush holder terminal stud (1) extends through but is insulated from the end plate. This stud is used for connection to the ground of the power supply as shown schematically in the diagram of internal motor circuits (fig. 
1-
--3). 

Figure 
1-
--3. 
Internal 
Motor 
Circuits 
 
3)  Each of the remaining brushes (or brush pairs) is in circuit with an assigned pair of series-
connected field windings. Starter, part number 1990272, has one brush and starter, part number 1109972, has two brushes in each of six brush holders. Refer to paragraph 1-
9 for design specifications.  
f.  Drive Housing. Drive housing (16) gives support to the bearing at drive-
end of the armature shaft and houses a portion of the drive clutch assembly (19). The drive housing is also the mounting flange for the starter and has three holes for bolts which attach the starter to an engine. The drive housing has a bolt hole pattern which permits it to be attached to lever housing (13) with the opening for drive pinion (18) access at anyone of 24 different rotational positions. Only one of these positions is correct for a particular engine application. Unused holes in this pattern are sealed with spherical rubber plugs.  
g.  Lever Housing. Lever housing (13) supports the center bearing for the armature, provides a mounting point for the drive housing, and provides a closure for drive end of the starter frame. It houses the inner portion of the drive clutch assembly. It supports and houses the shift mechanism.  
h.  Drive Clutch Assembly. Drive clutch assembly (19) is made up of an overrunning clutch, drive pinion (18), and a pinion engaging spring. The armature bore of this assembly has a straight spline which allows movement along the armature shaft, but locks clutch sleeve to armature shaft in rotation. The overrunning clutch is a seven-
roll assembly which allows rotation of the pinion sleeve within the clutch sleeve. Independent rotation of input or output can occur in one direction only.  
i.  Solenoid Assembly. Solenoid relay assembly (8) is a heavy-
duty, electro-
magnetically actuated switch. It has stud terminals at one end for connection to a power source and to the motor field winding terminal stud (4). Its case houses solenoid windings (9) and switch mechanism. The case mounts directly on frame assembly with four screws. The solenoid has two concentric windings: a pull-
in winding and a hold-
in winding. There are the same number of turns in each winding, but the pull-
in winding is coarser wire than the hold-
in winding.  
j.  Solenoid Plunger. Solenoid plunger (10) is the moveable core for the solenoid windings. It attaches to shift lever (15) and provides for adjustment of pinion clearance.  
k.  Shift Lever. Shift lever (15) pivots on a cross shaft supported by lever housing (13). This lever is positioned by the solenoid acting on solenoid plunger (10) or by plunger spring (12) when solenoid is not energized. The end of lever opposite that which connects to the plunger is a yoke for pushing drive clutch assembly (19) until drive pinion (18) is into mesh with the engine starter drive gear.

THEORY OF OPERATION 0003 
00 


THIS WORK PACKAGE COVERS: 
Theory of Operation 
DETAILED OPERATION 

a.  When 24 VDC power source is properly connected to ground terminal of starter motor and to BAT terminal of the solenoid assembly, any circuit which will apply this same voltage to terminal S on the solenoid assembly will energize the solenoid windings. Pull-
in winding will initially be grounded through the motor windings and commutator (a low resistance path); the hold-
in winding is connected direct to ground by the electrical lead assembly.  
b.  Current flow through the solenoid windings creates a magnetic field which pulls the plunger into the solenoid assembly. This movement linked through the shift lever slides drive clutch assembly nearer to drive end of the armature shaft (engaging pinion gear with an engine drive gear, if starter were mounted on an engine).  
c.  As the plunger bottoms in the solenoid assembly, it presses switch contact assembly against the motor terminal stud and the battery terminal stud inside the solenoid assembly case. The power circuit is completed to the starter motor when this switch is closed and the solenoid pull-
in winding is shorted. The solenoid hold-
in winding maintains switch closed against spring pressure until start control circuit is opened.  
d.  At any given armature position, power applied to the starter motor will provide current flow simultaneously through each of three paths to ground. Each path routes current through one pair of series-
connected field coils, through a brush-
to-
commutator contact, through two armature windings, and through the brush-
to-
commutator contact of an adjacent brush to ground. When current flows, each path generates an N and an S magnetic pole on the armature and an N and S magnetic pole on a pair of adjacent pole shoes in the frame assembly. Magnetic fields between these armature poles and pole shoes provide the starter’s output torque.  
e.  At output end of the starter, drive torque of the armature shaft is coupled through the clutch rolls (no slip direction) to the drive pinion.  
f.  If the drive pinion could not engage a drive gear because of gear tooth misalinement, the helical spline would be pushed through the drive pinion by overpowering the compression spring as necessary. This movement along the helical spline allows switch contacts in the solenoid assembly to be closed and armature to start rotation. The compression spring engages drive pinion with drive gear as soon as gear tooth alinement permits.  
g.  The overrunning action provided by the clutch rolls prevents an engine from driving the armature. At normal engine speeds, the ratio between the engine drive gear and the starter drive pinion would produce destructive rates of rotation for the starter armature were it not for the protection afforded by the overrunning clutch.  
h.  Operator should not hold start switch on (hold-
in winding energized) longer than 30 seconds at one time and should allow two minutes for starter to cool before engaging the starter again. Start switch should be released (turned off) as soon as an engine starts.  
i.  When start circuit is opened and while solenoid switch is still closed, solenoid windings are connected in a series circuit. Current flows through pull-
in winding in a reverse direction to that in hold-
in winding. This makes mutually canceling magnetic fields. With overall solenoid magnetic field thus neutralized, the return spring pressures open the solenoid switch and pull drive clutch assembly away from pinion-
engaged position.

--1, verify and determine the actual cause. Partial disassembly and/or specific tests may be required as noted by the column entries for that malfunction. Correct defects as applicable. 
1) 	Test Stand Operation. With the starter supported on a suitable test bench or stand (fig. 
2-
--1), 
check armature for freedom to rotate by prying on drive pinion as necessary to turn armature counterclockwise as viewed from drive end. 
2) 	Solenoid Shift Check. Connect power source or battery 
(fig. 
2-
--2) to the solenoid terminals as indicated. Briefly close, then open the switch. Drive clutch assembly should shift in response to switch closure and return when switch is opened.

3) 	No-
Load Speed and Current. Connect starter to power supply with circuit equivalent to 
Figure 
2-
--3. 
When the switch is closed, the armature should rotate at 5500 to 7500 rpm and current should be in the range of 95A to 120A when applied voltage is at least 20 VDC. 
NOTE 
Voltage higher than 20 VDC will cause higher rpm in cause a starter, but current draw will remain about the same because counter-
electromotive force (CEMF) will increase. 
4) 	Brush Lead Tightening. Low speed and low current are a symptom of high internal resistance which may be caused by loose attaching screws for brush leads. Torque loose brush lead screws as shown in Figure 
2-
--4 
to 18-
24 lb-
in (2.0 to 2.7 NSm).

5) 	Temporary Lubrication of Bearings. If starter produces excessive noise and a lack of lubrication is indicated, temporary lubrication of bearing(s) can be provided by punching a 1/16 inch diameter hole in seal plug over bearing wick (fig. 
2-
--5). Use an oiler to inject about one-
quarter fluid ounce of SAE No. 20 (non-
detergent) engine oil. Allow five minutes for oil to penetrate bearing. 
6) 	After allowing time for oil penetration, run starter again to see if lubrication reduces noise. Any seal plug punctured in this manner must be replaced before the starter is put back in ready-
for-
use status, but temporary lubrication can help the analysis of bearing condition during troubleshooting.

7) 	Housing Attaching Screws. If starter produces excessive noise because a housing is not securely fastened, check and/or torque attaching screws 
(fig. 
2-
--6) 
to 144-
192 lb-
in (16.3 to 21.7 N•m). 
8) 	Shift Lever. Remove the inspection plug for access to shift lever adjusting nut (fig.

10) Clutch Override. A clockwise (viewed from drive end) torque applied quickly to the drive pinion by thumb pressure when armature is at rest (fig. 
2-
--9) 
will check overrunning clutch. Drive pinion should rotate without rotating armature. 
11) Brush Arcing. When armature speed and starter current are both less than minimums indicated in preceding step (3), check for excessive arcing of brushes 
(Table 
2-
--1; 
Malfunction No. 8) during a no-
load run. 

Figure 
2-
9. Override Check 
12) Remove three brush inspection plugs 
(fig. 
2-
--10) and look into motor through each opening. Any unusual arcing seen at brush contact surface can be due to one or more of the causes listed in Table 
2-
--1. 

13) If arcing is localized to an area near a particular inspection hole, check for worn, binding, or broken brushes and/or a defective brush spring. 
14) Commutator problems should produce arcing in all three areas seen through inspection holes.

3. 	Armature Disassembly 
a. 	Check armature shaft and commutator. Replace if armature shaft bearing diameter exceeds 0.6835 to 0.6845 inch at commutator end and 0.6215 to 0.6230 inch at drive end. The diameter of the armature shaft bearing in the lever housing shall not exceed 0.8225 to 0.8240 inch. 
NOTE 
Low resistance of armature windings and interconnection through commutator bars make any and all commutator bars essentially the same circuit for this test. 
b. 	
Inspect armature for grounds with a test light by touching one of the test probes to the armature core and the other probe to one of the commutator bars. If the test light glows, the armature is grounded and must be replaced. 

c. 	
Inspect armature for short circuits using a growler fixture. Place the armature in growler. Hold a thin strip of steel, such as a hacksaw blade on the armature. While holding the steel strip in position, rotate the armature slowly. A short circuit will cause the strip to vibrate. If a short circuit is found, replace the armature. 




DISASSEMBLY OF THE STARTER ASSEMBLY -
CONTINUED 	0008 00 

d. 	
Commutator diameter on armature must be within 2.3080 to 2.3180 inches. Inspect armature shaft and commutator for eccentricity with a lathe or ”V” blocks and a dial indicator. If the eccentricity exceeds 0.0050 TIR, the commutator must be resurfaced provided it will not be cut below 2.1930 inch diameter limits. 

e. 	
Inspect armature shaft splines for wear. Replace the armature if the splines are defective. 

f. 	
Inspect the commutator contact surface. A satisfactory condition is indicated by an even, highly burnished, dark-
copper color. If the contact surface is rough, pitted, scored, burned, or coated with hard carbon or oil, the commutator must be resurfaced. If mica is not 0.025 to 0.032 inch below surface of commutator, it must be undercut to the correct depth. 


4. 	Disassembly Brush Holder Assembly. 

Compressed air used for cleaning purposes will not exceed 30 psi. Use only with effective chip guarding and personal protective equipment (goggles/shield, gloves, etc.). 
NOTE 
When disassembling a 12-

EXPLANATION OF CROSS-
REFERENCE INDEX FORMAT AND COLUMNS 
1. 	National Stock Number (NSN) Index. 
STOCK NUMBER Column. This column lists the NSN in National Item Identification Number (NIIN) sequence. The NIIN consists of the last nine digits of the NSN. 
NSN 	When using this column to locate an item, ignore the first four digits of the NSN. However, the complete NSN(e.g., 5385-
01-
574-
1476) should be used when ordering items by stock number.
NIIN 
FIG. Column. This column lists the number of the figure where the item is identified/located. The figures are in nu­merical order in the repair parts list and special tools list. 
ITEM Column. The item number identifies the item associated with the figure listed in the adjacent FIG. column. This item is also identified by the NSN listed on the same line. 
2. 	Part Number (P/N) Index. P/Ns in this index are listed in ascending numeric-
alpha sequence (vertical arrange­ment of number and letter combinations which places the first digit or letter of each group in order 0 through 9, followed by the letters A through Z and each following digit or letter in like order). 
PART NUMBER Column. Indicates the P/N assigned to the item. 
FIG. Column. This column lists the number of the figure where the item is identified/located in the repair parts list and special tools list. 
ITEM Column. The item number is in the number assigned to the item as it appears in the figure referenced in the adjacent figure number column. 
SPECIAL INFORMATION 
UOC. The UOC appears in the lower left corner of the Description Column heading. Usable on codes are shown as “UOC:…” in the Description Column (justified left) on the first line under the applicable item/nomenclature. Uncoded items are applicable to all models. 
Fabrication Instructions. Detailed fabrication instructions for items source coded to be manufactured or fabricated are found in WP 
0013 
00. 

Item Numbers. Items which have the word BULK in the figure column will have an index number shown in the item number column. This index number is a cross-
reference between the NSN / P/N index and the bulk material list in the repair parts list. 
Repair Parts Kits. Repair parts kits appear as the last entries in the repair parts listing for the figure in which its parts are listed as repair parts. 
Special Tool Sets. Special tool sets are stocked for initial issue. Tool set components are requisitioned as individual items. Stockage of tools that are duplicated in tool sets for other vehicles assigned or supported are not required be­yond actual need. 
HOW TO LOCATE REPAIR PARTS 
1. 	When NSNs or P/Ns are not known. 
A. 	Using the table of contents, determine the assembly group to which the item belongs. This is necessary since figures are prepared for assembly groups and subassembly groups, and lists are divided into the same groups. 
B. 	Find the figure covering the functional group or the subfunctional group to which the item belongs. 
C. 	Identify the item on the figure and note the number(s). 
D. 	Look in the repair parts list work packages for the figure and item numbers. The NSNs and part numbers are on the same line as the associated item numbers. 
2. 	When NSN is known. 
A. 	If you have the NSN, look in the Stock Number column of the NSN index. The NSN is arranged in NIIN sequence. Note the figure and item number next to the NSN. 
B. 	Turn to the figure and locate the item number. Verify that the item is the one you are looking for. 
3. 	When P/N is known. 
A. 	If you have the P/N and not the NSN, look in the Part Number column of the P/N index. Identify the figure and item number. 
B. 	Look up the item on the figure in the applicable repair parts list.

This fine document... 
Was brought to you by me: 




Liberated Manuals -- free army and government manuals 


Why do I do it? I am tired of sleazy CD-ROM sellers, who take publicly available information, slap “watermarks” and other junk on it, and sell it. Those masters of search engine manipulation make sure that their sites that sell free information, come up first in search engines. They did not create it... They did not even scan it... Why should they get your money? Why are not letting you give those free manuals to your friends? 
I am setting this document FREE. This document was made by the US Government and is NOT protected by Copyright. Feel free to share, republish, sell and so on. 
I am not asking you for donations, fees or handouts. If you can, please provide a link to liberatedmanuals.com, so that free manuals come up first in search engines:
