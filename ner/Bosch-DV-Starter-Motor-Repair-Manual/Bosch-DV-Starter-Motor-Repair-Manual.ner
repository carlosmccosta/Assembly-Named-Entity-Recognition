~ 
The new DV <PART>starter motor</PART> incorporates planetary drive and wound <PART>field coils</PART>, it has higher power output and is lighter in weight than previous models. 
The coaxial design of the DV <PART>starter</PART> allows it to directly replace conventional <PART>starters</PART> having the same mounting and <PART>pinion</PART> specifications. 
The <PART>drive end housing</PART> locates the <PART>planetary gear</PART> train which comprises of an <RPOS>outer</RPOS> <PART>gear hub</PART>, 3 needle <PART>roller idler gears</PART> attached to the <PART>output shaft</PART> and the armature with the <PART>input gear</PART> which passes through the <PART>cover plate</PART> on the <PART>main gear hub</PART> to form the complete assembly. The now familiar plastic fork <TOOL>lever</TOOL> and <PART>bearing block</PART> is used in the DV <PART>starter</PART>. 
Dismantling the <PART>starter motor</PART>: 
<OPER>Clamp</OPER> the <PART>starter motor</PART> in the vice using using Bosch clamp KDAW 9999 or soft jaws. Do not <RPOS>over</RPOS> <PROP>tighten</PROP> as this may cause distortion to the <PART>pole housing</PART>.

SECTION : 3 <PART>Starter</PART> PAGE: R25-2 DATE 5-93 
Inspection of the brush holder: 
Ensure that the brushes move freely in their holders, that the brushes are free 
from chips and bum marks. <OPER>Check</OPER> brush minimum length (7mm) if shorter than 
the minimum, <OPER>replace</OPER> the brush set. 

<OPER>Removal</OPER> and replacement of brushes: 

Gently <OPER>bend</OPER> <RPOS>back</RPOS> the brush retaining tab until the <PART>spring</PART> and brush can be 
removed, (if any tag is broken the whole brush holder must be replaced). 
<OPER>Clean</OPER> the brush holders making sure they are free from carbon deposits and 
burrs. 

Cleaning components: 

The following components must not be cleaned with <PART>spirit</PART> based agents, only 
clean rags and compressed air must be used, they are Armature, <PART>field coils</PART>, 
<PART>solenoid switch</PART> and <PART>drive assembly</PART>. 
All other mechanical components may be cleaned using non volatile or low 
inflammable agents in a well ventilated area, it is important that the parts are 
thoroughly dried before assembly, take care not to breath in the vapours. 
Please observe the safety regulations and precautions issued by the 
manufacturer of the cleaning agent in use. 

Replacement of positive brushes: 

Cut old brush lead about mm away from the <PART>field coil connecting strap</PART>, tin lead 
with 60/40 resin cored solder take new brush and <OPER>position</OPER> it on the 
pre-tinned lead with pointed nosed pliers. <PART>Solder</PART> new brush to the lead. 

Replacement of negative brushes( earth): 

Cut old brush lead flush with the <PART>brush plate</PART>, pre-tin the remaining <PART>copper lead</PART> 
on the <PART>brush plate</PART> with 60/40 resin cored solder. Using a pair of pointed nosed 
pliers position and <PART>solder</PART> new brushes to the <PART>brush plate</PART>. 

Caution: Ensure that the <PART>solder</PART> does not run up the lead by capillary 
action which makes the lead inflexible. Please also note the direction the 
earth brushes are soldered to the <PART>plate</PART>.

SECTION : 3 <PART>Starter</PART> PAGE: R25-3 DATE 5-93 
Testing the <PART>field coils</PART>: 
Test the <PART>field coil</PART> for <PROP>short</PROP> <PART>circuits</PART> to earth using an insulation tester with a minimum AC voltage of 40volts or Bosch tester KDAW 9984, KDAW 9985. <OPER>Inspect</OPER> the <PART>coils</PART> for signs of overheating, if this condition is present they should be replaced. 
<OPER>Removal</OPER> and replacement of <PART>field coils</PART>. 
The new DV <PART>starter</PART> uses an interlocked joint in the <PART>pole housing</PART>, care should be exercised whenever the <PART>pole housing</PART> is clamped to fit or <OPER>remove</OPER> the <PART>field coils</PART>, it is recommended that a mandrill having a diameter of 52.8+0.2-0.1 mm. x 70mm long be placed <RPOS>inside</RPOS> the <PART>pole housing</PART> to <PART>support</PART> the pole shoes whilst the <PART>screws</PART> are removed. <OPER>Place</OPER> the <PART>pole housing</PART> in a vice or <PART>clamping support</PART> using a Posidriv No3 bit <OPER>remove</OPER> the <PART>pole screws</PART>, <OPER>pull</OPER> the <PART>fields</PART> out the brush end complete with the mandrill and pole shoes. 
<OPER>Installing</OPER> the <PART>field coils</PART>: 
<OPER>Insert</OPER> the pole shoes <RPOS>into</RPOS> the new <PART>field coils</PART> and <OPER>place</OPER> <RPOS>inside</RPOS> the <PART>pole housing</PART>, <OPER>install</OPER> the <PART>pole shoe screws</PART> finger <OPER>tight</OPER>, now <OPER>insert</OPER> the <PART>support mandrill</PART> to hold and <PART>support</PART> the fields. <PART>Clamp pole housing</PART> and <OPER>tighten</OPER> the <PART>screws</PART> to a torque of 20-25 Nm and <OPER>remove</OPER> the mandrill. After <OPER>installation recheck</OPER> the <PART>coils</PART> for earths using an insulation tester. A reading of 1 megohm or greater should be expected. 
Testing the armature: 
The armature should be clean before testing. <OPER>Check</OPER> for <PROP>short</PROP> <PART>circuits</PART> using an armature growler or similar tester. Test the <PROP>insulation</PROP> resistance to earth using a megger or similar tester. A reading 1 megohm or greater should be expected. The <PART>commutator</PART> should be examined for any sign of burned or darkened segments as this is usually an indication of open circuited <PART>windings</PART>. 
SECTION : 3 <PART>Starter</PART> PAGE: R25-4 DATE 5-93 
Machining and undercutting the <PART>commutator</PART>: 

If worn segments are evident on the <PART>commutator</PART> it must be machined until the 
working surface is clean, note that the minimum size for the <PART>commutator</PART> is 
31.2mm. When machining the armature it must not be held by the laminations. 
The Armature must be held at the drive end and supported at the <PART>commutator 
end bearing</PART> surface. 
It is recommended that the <PART>commutator</PART> be turned in two stages, that is pre 
turning and finish turning. In the pre turning stage the <PART>commutator</PART> is undercut 
to a maximum depth of O.Bmm. Please note, it is most important to use 
dust extraction when undercutting <PART>commutators</PART>. 

After undercutting the <PART>commutator</PART> <OPER>place</OPER> the armature in the lathe and finish 
cut using a fine tool. The cut should be no more than 0.03mm. After turning, 
brush out the <PART>commutator slots</PART> using a stiff brush and <OPER>polish</OPER> surface if 
necessary. 
Runout should be less than 0.1 mm for the <PART>commutator</PART> and 0.5mm for the 
laminations. 

Preparation of sintered bushes: 
The <PART>bushings</PART> used in <PART>starter motors</PART> are made from porous sintered metal and 
as such they will hold <PART>oil</PART> to provide lubrication. It is important that the bushes 
are pre lubricated prior to fitting. This can be achieved by soaking the bushes 
over night in <PART>mineral oil</PART>. If time does not permit over night soaking <PART>oil</PART> can be 
forced <RPOS>into</RPOS> the bush by <OPER>placing</OPER> a thumb <RPOS>over</RPOS> one end of the bush and <OPER>filling</OPER> it 
with <PART>oil</PART>. Using the other thumb press firmly until the <PART>oil</PART> is visiable on the <RPOS>outer</RPOS> 
surfaces of the bush. 

<PART>Drive end housing</PART>: 


<OPER>Inspect</OPER> the <PART>housing</PART> for wear or cracking, examine mounting surfaces and 
threaded holes for damage, if <PART>housing</PART> is serviceable using a suitable drift 
press out old bush and fit a new one. 

<PART>Commutator end housing</PART>: 

<OPER>Inspect</OPER> the <PART>housing</PART> for damage. If serviceable press out old <PART>bushing</PART> and 
<OPER>replace</OPER> with a new one. 

WJE-06-AL-25-4 SECTION : 3 <PART>Starter</PART> PAGE: R25-5 DATE 5-93 
Inspection of <PART>drive shaft</PART> and <PART>planetary assembly</PART>: 

Carefully examine the assembly for signs of wear or cracking. If worn replace 
the whole planetary drive. The <PART>planetary gear hub</PART> and bush may be replaced 
separately if required. To replace the hub <OPER>remove</OPER> the <PART>circlip</PART> and thrust <PART>washer</PART> 
and withdraw the <PART>planetary shaft</PART>. To <OPER>reassemble</OPER> reverse the procedure. 
Note: The <PART>planetary gears</PART> are pre lubricated, a <QTY>small amount</QTY> of <PART>light oil</PART> may 
be used to <OPER>lubricate</OPER> the armature <PART>spigot bushing</PART> prior to <OPER>reassembly</OPER>. 
The helix for the <PART>drive assembly</PART> must be lubricated with <PART>lithium based grease</PART> 
only. 

<PART>Drive assembly</PART>: 

<OPER>Inspect</OPER> the <PART>pinion</PART> for signs of wear or chipped teeth, <OPER>rotate</OPER> the <PART>pinion</PART> by hand 
and <OPER>check</OPER> for any signs of roughness or <OPER>slipping</OPER>, examine the <PART>pinion bush</PART> for 
<RPOS>wear</RPOS> or scoring, if in doubt replace the <PART>drive assembly</PART>. 

<PART>Solenoid</PART> testing: 

<OPER>Inspect</OPER> the <PART>solenoid</PART> for damage, test the winding de resistance. 
Hold-in Winding 1.16 ... 1.3 Ohms. 
Pull-in Winding 0.248 ... 0.281 Ohms. 
Test temperature +20"C 
During hold in and <OPER>pull</OPER> in tests the <PART>solenoid</PART> is held vertically,ie <PART>plunger</PART> 
uppermost. It is recommended that a rubber band be installed to prevent the 
<PART>plunger</PART> from flinging out during testing. 

Testing the pull-in voltage: 

Using a power supply capable of supplying 30 amperes , <OPER>set</OPER> the voltage to 3.0 

volts. A <PART>battery</PART> and variable resistor may also be used. 
<OPER>Connect</OPER> the <PART>solenoid</PART> as per the <PART>wiring diagram</PART> fig 2. 
<OPER>Connect</OPER> a 12 volt test lamp between terminal 30 and +12 volt supply and a 
<TOOL>voltmeter</TOOL> <RPOS>between</RPOS> terminal 50 and ground. 
Fully press in <PART>solenoid plunger</PART> until lamp lights. <OPER>Allow</OPER> the <PART>plunger</PART> to spring out 
by approximately 8-10mm and hold in this position. Slowly increase the 
voltage on terminal 50 until the <PART>plunger pulls</PART> in; note <TOOL>voltmeter</TOOL> reading. At the 
same time the lamp must light fully. (main contact continuity) 
The voltage should be between 3.0v -6.5 volts.Test duration 2 seconds. 

SECTION : 3 <PART>Starter</PART> PAGE: R25-6 DATE 5-93 
Testing the hold-in voltage: 
<OPER>Set</OPER> the power supply to 12 volts, <OPER>connect</OPER> the positive lead to terminal 50 of the <PART>solenoid</PART> and <OPER>connect</OPER> the negative lead to the <PART>case</PART> of the <PART>solenoid</PART>. <OPER>Press</OPER> the <PART>plunger</PART> fully home, it will be held by the hold-in winding. Now <OPER>decrease</OPER> the voltage until the winding will no longer hold the plunger. Note the <TOOL>voltmeter</TOOL> reading, this is the release voltage which should be 
between 0.2v -2.0 volts. 
Testing the contact burn off reserve: 
<OPER>Press</OPER> the <PART>plunger</PART> until the contacts close, this will be indicated when the lamp comes on. It must be possible to <OPER>push</OPER> the <PART>plunger</PART> another 1 mm or more <RPOS>towards</RPOS> the magnetic core. If less than 1 mm the <PART>solenoid</PART> must be replaced. 
Testing for interwinding <PROP>short</PROP> <PART>circuits</PART>: 
A 24 volt supply is required for this test. Apply positive supply to terminal 30 (<PART>main battery</PART> supply input) and negative to the casing. <OPER>Press</OPER> the <PART>plunger</PART> fully home. <OPER>Release</OPER> the plunger, it should return to it's rest position by the action of the return spring. If it does not the <PART>windings</PART> have interwinding <PROP>short</PROP> <PART>circuits</PART>. When the <PART>solenoid</PART> is connected in this way the <PART>windings</PART> are differentially compounded, that is, their <PART>fields</PART> are in opposition to each other. See Fig 3. 
Mechanical data ,<PART>solenoid</PART>: 
Bum off reserve: 0.8-1.4mm 
Pre-stressed tension of reset spring for moving contact. 12+ 3N 
Pre-stressed tension of contact pressure spring. 19N. 
Pre-stressed tension of <PART>plunger spring</PART> with 9mm <PART>plunger</PART> clearance. 45+ 7N 

Total spring force 113N 
Lightly <OPER>grease</OPER> the <PART>plunger</PART> with <PART>special grease</PART>, Bosch No 5 932 240 150 or equivalent. Do not under any circumstances allow <PART>grease</PART> on the face of the plunger. If too much <PART>grease</PART> is applied it may enter the contact chamber and cause contact problems.
